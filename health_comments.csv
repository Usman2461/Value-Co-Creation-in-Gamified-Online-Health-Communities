How low are you when you are 'low'? Under 4 (72)? If so, being irritated and anxious can be signs of low blood sugar and you need to do a finger prick test to confirm the low, then 15g of fast acting sugar (candy, juice, dex4). Wait 15 minutes and test again. Repeat with another 15g of fast acting sugar until you are back into a normal range. 

You need to make sure that you are testing your blood sugar and act accordingly. Your goal is to have your blood sugar between 4-10 (72-180). And keep in mind that if you had high blood sugar for a long time, your body got used to it, so being at a normal blood sugar range can feel like a low and can take your body time to get used to.

Also list her symptoms, and jot down all the questions you want answers to, just so you can be sure you cover everything while you're in there, and don't forget anything. Obviously put her journal of symptoms on a separate page/s, so you can give it to the doctor to peruse, so he has a clear idea of what he may be looking at.

1knw7h9,msna6sw,smthamazing,2025-05-16 16:06:52,"Hi! I'm a woman in my late 30s, physically very weak. I've been doing resistance bands and other strength workouts for the past few months, and while I like some progress there, I'm curious about the optimal rest duration between reps and sets.

When I'm doing an exercise, my arms or legs often give up after as few as 3 reps on the lightest band I could find. I just physically cannot do more - not because it's painful, but because my muscles just ""stop working"" after a certain point. It takes 2-3 minutes before I can do the next set, and up to 15-20 minutes for full recovery without feeling any discomfort.

However, if I do a set of 3 and then rest for 20-30 minutes, I don't feel any muscle tiredness _at all_. I can do another set, feeling as good as new, but each time my muscles give up after a few reps.

In theory I could literally exercise for the whole day by doing 30-minute rests, but I've never seen this suggested anywhere. All sources seem to recommend a single good workout with relatively short (less than 5 minutes) breaks between sets.

So, is there any point in doing very short sets throughout the day with lots of rest in between? Or do they not bring much value beyond the first one, where I do as many repetitions as I can?

Thanks!",1,0.9669
1knw7h9,msnluqz,koenigsaurus,2025-05-16 17:03:37,"So this might be a weird question but idk where else to post it:

Does anyone else only start sweating *after* your workout is finished? I enjoy all kinds of cardio, primarily running and basketball. But I’ve always had an issue where during the workout, I barely sweat at all. I’ve had coaches in my youth try to run me ragged until I started to sweat because they thought I wasn’t working hard enough. But it just doesn’t happen.

But when I’m finished with the workout, the floodgates open and I start dripping sweat everywhere. This goes on for 20ish minutes or until I start working out again. So I end up not being cool enough during the workout when I need the sweat, and having to wait a long time after I’m finished before I can clean up.

I’m wondering if there’s anyway I can “train” my body to sweat during activity instead of after it.",1,0.5936

Obviously a successful diet is a personal thing, different things will work better or worse for different people, but the big change I made this time around was to think about diet from a weekly calorie budget instead of a daily one. Days that I go to the gym, I budget in a bunch of sugar before my workout and a big meal afterwards, on days I lounge around at home, I eat very little.

Doing this, I've managed to stick to a pretty regular routine, haven't really needed to adjust calorie intake or eating habits as I lose weight, and haven't suffered from any nasty diet side effects like grumpiness, hunger pains or loss of energy/strength. An added bonus is that I have a couple of back to back near fasting days, and weighing myself at the end of that stretch makes it much easier to track progress. Surprisingly, my body weight varies by 3-4% over the course of the week between the effects of the gym, fiber intake, sodium intake, carb intake, etc, it'd be really easy to lose the around 1% body weight loss I'm achieving per week in that noise if I didn't have that regular weekly reset.",9,0.9124

 For the brands I buy, at least, this gives it a smooth, mousse like consistency that's very pleasant! I even sometimes add a tiny bit of water to get the same effect if the yogurt is a bit thicker than I like.

Also, on a cut, swapping out your normal sized spoon for a teaspoon can be quite fun, makes it feel like you have so much food because it fills up the spoon and takes longer to eat. This possibly only works if you have quite a simple brain, but it works for me lol",20,0.937

If you’re still treating your warm-up like 5 minutes on a treadmill and a few arm circles, you’re missing out.

A good warm-up does more than raise your heart rate—it prepares your joints, muscles, and nervous system to perform.

Try this 4-step warm-up flow before your main lift:

Target a tight area with 30 seconds of foam rolling or a lacrosse ball

Stretch that area with 15–30 seconds of static stretching

Add a dynamic movement for 10–15 reps (e.g., leg swings, band pull-aparts)

Do 2–3 ramp-up sets of your main lift, increasing load and speed each time

I just started working out again (its been years) and I'm noticing that every now and then my body finds a workout weird. 2 noticeable ones:

1. Dumbbell Bicep Curls; My left arm feels something weird when doing these. Its as if I have a tendon or vein that's in the way, and it gets pushed around when I do the curls. Not hugely painful, but uncomfortable and it feels like I might pull something if I push too hard. The feeling is at the bottom right (of my left forearm). Is this something that's common? What should I do? (Hammer curls feel much better. Right arm is fine with both. Left arm isn't weaker, I can still do about the same amount of reps.)
2. Dumbbell Lateral Raise: My shoulders crack/pop a bit when doing this. I pushed myself once and got a huge stiff neck right after. So I've been taking it easy with this.
