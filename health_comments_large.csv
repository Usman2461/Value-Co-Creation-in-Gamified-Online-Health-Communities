I know that seems scary having an insulin pump, but being able to gauge the changes to how your body will react to the insulin is gonna be very important in working through this disability. The largest thing is gonna be your insulin Bolus settings. You’ll want your target range to be around 110-150, and you’ll wanna start with a correction range that is higher so that you can avoid the lows until you have a proper gauge of what’s going on. If you remember your correction range from when you were doing insulin manually, start there. For instance, mine right now is 30 mg/dl, and I have that set for 3 hours. These numbers are gonna be different for you, and you’ll have to closely monitor them to find a healthy spot. If you’re dropping low very fast, raise the correction number, if you’re staying high, lower the correction number. It’s a long process but it’s important to monitor your values.",1,0.5153

How low are you when you are 'low'? Under 4 (72)?

Wait 15 minutes and test again. Repeat with another 15g of fast acting sugar until you are back into a normal range. 

You need to make sure that you are testing your blood sugar and act accordingly. Your goal is to have your blood sugar between 4-10 (72-180).

IF readings also tend to lag behind blood readings (blood shows changes first) so if your numbers are changing rapidly it’s not reflected in a CGM reading as early as it would be from a finger prick. There is also the 20% variation rate that is acceptable for all monitors so if device is erring 10-20% high and the other 10-20% low, you’re going to see a decent difference in the 2. This can be compounded if your sugar is going up or down quickly.

You may have a bum sensor or it may be something they are giving you at the hospital. I also use Libre and have found it to be accurate enough to make treatment decisions most of the time.

1kp517b,msv7pks,No_Cable_3311,2025-05-17 22:42:45,"Hello,

I can’t speak for your mom’s diet, because everyone’s diabetes is different and everyone’s food needs are different. However, I will give you the information I received for myself from my diabetes educator in terms of diet, and you can see if they work for your needs. I would talk to your mom—she can give you more information about her specific trigger foods. 

For reference, I am 29F, 5’6”, and 157 lbs.

Diet: My diabetes educator put me on a diet of 20-30 carbs per meal, with a max of 45g if I went to the gym afterwards. So I know that if I can’t make it to the gym, even for a brisk walk after dinner, I can only eat 30g of carbs total. 

They advised me to ignore the “net carbs” thing, i.e., counting fiber, because carbs from fiber can still raise blood sugar. I know those “carb balance” tortillas are like 32g of carbs or something on their own. That being said, incorporating meals that have complex carbs with lots of fiber and protein help control spikes, so make sure you have meals with high amounts of both.

Because you mention being Indian, I thought I would say that I have a lot of Indian food as a diabetic. If you are not vegetarian, chicken dishes with low-sugar sauces are wonderful, flavorful, and easy to cook. I love daal, so I eat lots of it, and that helps with the protein and fiber. Just watch portion sizes because those add up quickly with lentils. I avoid rice. I recommend riced cauliflower. When it’s covered in a nice palak paneer, I don’t even miss the rice. 

I also love using the Joseph’s oat, flax and bran pitas and improvising some naan. They’re only 7g of carbs and have a good amount of protein and fiber, and they work for my purposes. Not authentic, but diabetes friendly :) https://netrition.com/products/josephs-bakery-mini-pitas?currency=USD&variant=42210038612150&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping&stkn=b4d6930959ce&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=17521158122&gbraid=0AAAAAD_jiKA4OnC2FOM3Njz446EGNQ6MO&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIz9DOsMmrjQMVR0hHAR3XTx25EAQYCCABEgKOqfD_BwE

Avoid starches, like potatoes. My educator told me that some people spike from tomatoes and peas, so be mindful of that, but I personally don’t have an issue with them. 

Hope this helps!",3,0.9852

I grew up with an Indian grandfather and making his curry recipe is special to me. I was devastated when I thought I wouldn't be able to enjoy it with rice anymore. This trick saved me. I wear a CGM and the difference in blood glucose impact is night and day.

On top, going through cycles of constipation (no need to use the bathroom for 3 days) and diarrhea but not a big deal.

One of the ways I cope is by controlling what groceries I buy and keep in the house.  I very deliberately do not keep ""cheat foods"" in the house, so that in times of weakness I couldn't cheat if I wanted to.

My other big safeguard against self-destructive behavior is cultivated habit.  When I'm down, if I have a strongly ingrained habit, even though it's hard to do *anything*, when I can do anything it's easier to do tasks I have made into habits.

The key to cultivating habits is repetition, doing the exact same thing the exact same way every day for at least twenty days.  It's like wearing a groove in your mind so that it takes extremely little motivation to push yourself through that well-worn groove.

For example, in the morning I run the dogs out, collect eggs from the chickens' layboxes, feed the cats, write the date on the eggs with a sharpie, and crack four or five of them for my breakfast.

After that my practice diverges, but the process up to that point is a solid habit.  When I'm down, sometimes the pets' needs are the only thing getting me out of bed, at all.  Once I run the dogs out, though, ***the habit has been started,*** and it would take *more* effort to *not* perform the rest of the ritual than it would to go ahead and do it.

No blood is involved, which is why it's not quite as accurate as a blood drop test. 

There's always a lot of talk about this, so let's be clear: there is NO WAY to test blood sugar by *anything* on the surface of your skin.  There are devices that can estimate blood glucose using exhaled fluid, but those are also not great and are generally used in a hospital or hospice setting.  Any watch claiming to display blood sugar (or blood pressure) on its own is an absolute scam.  It's the digital equivalent of a copper bracelet.  Even the galaxy app doesn't communicate directly with the CGM: it just receives some of the data from your CGM's phone app.

If you want totally non-invasive alerts about tour blood sugar, train a dog.  You'll still have to do a finger stick to confirm before acting on their alert, but they're also cuter than a smart watch",1,0.0321

&nbsp; 

Don’t go into the omnipod thinking it is a closed loop or artificial pancreas, as that is 100% NOT what it is. It is a standard (disposable) insulin pump with integrated infusion set and reservoir that just happens to also hook up to a cgm for the bare minimum automated basal adjustments. The algorithm that omnipod uses is so laggy in any corrections that you will end up blousing yourself for any arrant highs anyhow. The bolus calculator also has 0 correction factor changes based on time of day, or activity level, or bg trend (up or down) , etc, so you will still have to do all that math yourself anyhow. 

You might also be disappointed in how large it is considering how much omni advertises the “noninvasive” nature of it.  The full assembly will stand off your body by about an inch and a half (37mm iirc conversions right). It’s big enough that under a T shirt anyone looking will notice it. Anything blunt (like inventory shelves, tables, door frames, or heck even other humans sometimes) WILL catch on it. If you catch it on something in my experience, there is about a 50% gamble of if you are going to rip it clean off or just nudge it enough to occlude the cannula. Maybe 10% of the time will it be just fine.

One thing to consider is what is your daily usage of insulin going to be? Omnipods hold up to 200 units of insulin vs the tslim’s 300 units. If your insulin needs are lower, an omnipod may be a good choice. If not, I would pick the tslim over the Medtronic all day long.

Now, I am still eating carbs daily, and sometimes even a sweet treat, but the trick is moderation and portion control. I think being in the hospital for 10 days and then staying with friends for a couple of weeks as my apartment was cleaned and furniture arrived really helped since there was someone there to be held accountable to what I was eating. (But, I am the kind of person that would only overeat while alone). So that helped reset my stomach/brain a bit and get it used to normal people portions. 

Other tricks that have helped me, don't buy the snacks and have them in the house. Have easy to grab alternatives (cheese, meat sticks, crunchy dried edamame beans, sugar free or diet soda). If you want the treat, make yourself go out and get them and buy an individual portion so you can't overindulge. (At least for me, it's going to be the cost/benefit analysis of ""Do I really want that enough to put on outside clothes to go and get it?"").

Cutting calories is hard, but you can try switching higher calorie items for less, adding more veggies and protein, using leaner cuts of meat, higher fiber and whole wheat breads vs white. 

And a tip that has been suggested to me- mindful eating. Do nothing else but eat the food. Take TINY bites. Savour the texture and taste.

 And if you are using larger plates, change the plate size. Smaller plates with the same amount of food on a large plate will look like more to your brain.",1,0.9628

A lot of people will tell you to completely cut out carbs but I personally find that if I go too low carb I feel terrible and hungry all the time. Carbohydrates (glucose) are the human body’s preferred source of energy. Even when you have a metabolic disorder that prevents the glucose from getting into your cells (diabetes), your cells still want to be burning glucose for energy. This might be why you are struggling to cut calories. The common narrative is that people get T2 diabetes from overeating, but you have to be predisposed to it in the first place, and diabetes can be the cause of over-eating because when your body isn’t actually using your food for fuel it can make you more hungry. 

A registered dietitian can help you to figure out how to cut calories and still feel like you are getting enough food, and how to incorporate your favorite foods in a balanced diet. Exercise, stress reduction, good sleep, and medication can all help improve insulin sensitivity so that your body can use glucose for energy more effectively.",1,0.896

Engineered foods are calorie dense and desirable, and trying to find a path that circles around this by swapping ""diabetic friendly"" options for traditional junk food leaves you in the same position with maybe SLIGHTLY fewer total carbs but feeling like you can eat MORE since it's ""better for you.""

Genuinely give the 50% non-starch veg, 25% lean protein, 25% starch by plate area strategy a try. Every lunch and dinner and all snacks. You CAN do this. Be kind to yourself, be honest with your effort, and keep trying.

I tried otherwise, portion control, but it's impossible when it comes to cookies, etc - I'm good for a week, then, emotional upset - BINGE! I wish therapists would get a grasp on this - sometimes not having a food item in the house is the right choice, it's not ""restricting"" or ""disordered eating"" or ""being too hard on yourself.""

It's a real struggle, unless I have rigid rules in place, which is actually freeing, I don't have to think about it all. ""Sugar on holidays"" simplifies everything.

If all you eat is food that a bunch of lab coat scientists spent millions in developing with additives and sweeteners, you are lost from the start. 

  
You need to reset your expectations. Let food taste boring for a month, militantly avoid ultra-processed food like pre-made meals, snacks, and similar UHPs as much as you can. 

  
You will have to learn how to cook, but generally, balancing salt, fat, and acid as an approach to seasoning will go very far in making delicious vegetables. They will NEVER taste like your ultra palatable foods that are designed to be as addicting as legally possible. Again, broadly, cook vegetables in a little bit of oil (LITTLE BIT), salt them, and then finish with something acidic like a tiny splash of vinegar or hot sauce. Steam vegetables when you can, and pay attention to overcooking them. There are HUNDREDS of video tutorials on YouTube, just pick one a day and give it a shot. Just remember that your goal is to eat healthier, not make replications of unhealthy food. Fast food and restaurant style food is not healthy.

Salt them with a course salt sprinkle (any pure salt is fine, just don't use garlic or onion salt), toss some cracked pepper and something fun, and then roast them in an oven at 425F. I put them in the oven cold. I'll let them ride for like 15-20 minutes, then check. When I poke them with a fork and they mostly give (tender but firm, you'll have to learn this), I pull and plate. Add some spring mix to the side, and drizzle with a super simple homemade vinaigrette that's just oil, mustard, vinegar and maybe some dried basil. Boom, that's your meal. You can make a big batch of the carrots, and then refrigerate for multiple meals if you don't like cooking every day. 

  
Do the research. Use your judgement. Learn the basics of nutrition. YOU GOT THIS! Most importantly, stay the course and be honest with yourself.",2,0.9926

What is that UHP you mention? I had thought you meant Ultra Processed Foods but the initials are wrong. haha

I've been trying to look at international foods but it seems that every culture has a huge amount of their foods based on breads, potatoes, rice, or pasta. It's frustrating.

The carrots sound good, but I've seen them on lists of foods bad for diabetics. It seems their glycemic index goes up when cooked.

I believe I have a fairly good understanding of nutrition, it's the fact I can't find foods I actually like that's the problem.",1,0.746
1kol0bu,msycy2g,GriffTheMiffed,2025-05-18 13:51:23,"Sorry, it meant to stand for Ultra or Highly Processed. I use this regularly but its not a standard phrase. 

  
Regarding the carrots, yes their glycemic index goes up, but they aren't as bad as a straight carb. It's a HUGE improvement and is a familiar and versatile food. You don't need to put the cart before the horse, don't use ""this isn't perfect"" as an excuse to not dive into eating healthier. Beans are relatively high in carbs and don't have the most favorable glycemic index but are a critical staple for my own management of Type 2. Most of my meals are relatively plain, but they are delicious, nutritious, and incredibly inexpensive. I can prep up these ""complex ingredients"" and save huge amount of time and effort. I've lost so much weight with this, and saved a ton. 

  
It is helpful that you have a decent understanding of nutrition, you can use that knowledge to start making meaningful comparisons for yourself. Sit down with a macro tracker and some recipes and understand how macros play out. Pay attention to net-carbs, overall fiber intake (greatly improves satiety, or the experience of feeling that you ate enough), and managing overall carbs per meal and overall calories. 

  
Try and get a reset in, re-teach your brain what the value of food is and what you find that tastes good. It WILL change, and you will feel better! You can do this! Stop eating crap all the time, and start feeling better!",1,0.9951

As far as how it feels, I think it's way more comfortable than doing fingersticks multiple times a day and far more convenient.

Insertion is very quick and always painless for me. Once it's on, I never notice it, and like you, I don't like wearing jewelry. I never feel it my sleep or anything.

It is possible to set of an alarm if it's placed in a spot that you lie on a lot. The compression will set off a false low. Since I'm a side sleeper, I'll roll around in bed before applying the monitor and find the spot that least likely will squish the monitor then apply it there.",4,0.9117

I can't wear mine on my arm since I am a side sleeper and putting pressure on it will usually give a compression low (false low cause by compressing the sensor and area), so I wear mine on my stomach.

It's just information. Use the information and learn from it.
Additionally it's not going to guilt you into eating healthy, because I can eat pancakes with syrup and as long as I dose my insulin correctly my CGM will not show a spike because I will have dosed correctly for that particular meal - but it certainly isn't my healthiest choice.

It, besides the medication I'm taking, has been the single greatest point of control I've felt over my diabetes. I can, in almost real time, see how I physically respond to different inputs in my life. It's changed a lot for how I live. 

  
One big complaint I have is that these sensors just aren't engineered for how active I am. The adhesive is just terrible, and I end up adding and replacing extra protection about every 5 days. It's a small issue overall, but darn is it annoying if I have a unit fall out. It's also a lot of experimentation to figure out what adhesives are best.

1kodrem,mspkkbi,HawkTenRose,2025-05-16 23:25:31,"T1.

Short version: yes it’s normal.

Long version:

When you are sick, your body does two things.

One, liver releases glycogen, which turns into glucose, to give you energy to help fight the infection

Two: stress hormones are released.
Cortisol and adrenaline can both increase insulin resistance (in this context, I refer to insulin resistance as insulin being less effective in use, meaning you need more to have the same effect on blood sugar.)


In a healthy body, more insulin is released to cope with that. T1’s don’t
produce insulin though, we are not physically capable of doing this. The
symptoms of high blood sugar and resulting ketones can add to those of
the original illness or infection and make it much worse.

…

Were you ever taught sick day rules?

Illness can either be minor or severe in diabetes. *These terms are diabetes specific, they do not refer to the illness itself, more the effect they have on diabetes.*

Defining minor or severe depends on how many ketones you have in your
blood. Minor illness means no significant amount of ketones (neglible or trace amounts, if urine testing and less than 1.5 mmol in blood ketone strips); your blood glucose may or may not be raised.

Severe illness is when there are a significant number of ketones and blood glucose is typically above target range (usually above 13.0 mmol/l.)

Minor sick day rules:

Keep checking blood sugar every four hours, even during the night. If any
of those checks are above 13.0 mmol, you should check ketones at the
same time. It isn’t unusual to have starvation ketones if you haven’t eaten in a while - this is typically seen as present but not life threatening, below 1.5 mmol/l- and can easily be rectified with a small snack and short acting insulin using your normal insulin to carb ratio. If blood sugar is high, you can also use correction doses. Bananas, toast, or fruity yogurt are always a good idea, as they go down fairly easy.

Remember to keep hydrated, at least 100 ml per hour. If your BG is in target (4-10 mmol, 72-180 mg/dl) and you aren't eating, skip any fast acting and just take long acting. If you are not eating but your blood sugar is out of range, you can correct even without food. 1 unit of insulin will typically lower you 2.5-3 mmol/l. (45-54)

NEVER SKIP YOUR LONG ACTING INSULIN.

Severe sick day rules

This is often associated with visible signs of illness (fever and presence of
infection.) You may need a significant increase in insulin to combat the rise
in both blood sugar and ketones.

If blood ketones are at or above 1.5 mmol (trace or higher in urine strips)
and blood glucose is over 13.0 mmol, (234) this is considered severe.

Keep hydrated, at least 100 ml per hour.

Check ketones and blood sugar every two hours.

Calculate a typical daily dose of insulin (this is both basal and bolus
together; with carb counting, bolus can vary so just do your best to figure
an average amount. *For me, this is 6 and 15 basal (21) and 6, 3, 9, and
maybe 4 bolus (breakfast, lunch, dinner, maybe snacks or dessert if I
fancy) so 43 in total.*


If ketones are 1.5-3.0 mmol (blood) or small-moderate (urine) take 10% of
total daily dose, and take every two hours as supplemental insulin plus
normal basal insulin as usual and normal short acting if you are eating. 

For me, as my total daily dose is 43 ish, I would divide by 10 to get 4.3, rounded to nearest whole number is 4, so 4 units every two hours as a supplement, in addition to my normal basal and normal bolus if I want to eat.


If ketones are above 3.0 mmol, or large on urine strips, give 20% of total
daily dose every two hours as supplemental insulin plus normal basal insulin as usual and normal short acting if you are eating. For me, as my total daily dose is around 43, I would divide by 10 to get 4.3, then multiply by 2 to get 20%, which is 8.6 rounded to nearest whole number is 9 units every two hours as a supplement, in addition to my normal basal and normal bolus if I want to eat.

*Based on the way that chart looks, I would probably be following the 10% extra bolus regime every two hours, on top your increased basal and your normal IC ratio for carbs.*",12,0.8459

As you get your blood sugar under control from being high, a normal BS can feel like a low - usually what happens is that your body gets better used to the normal blood sugar and it stops feeling so bad.  Since you are experiencing disorientation with your lows, and they're unexpected, it's a good sign you should get a CGM prescribed so you can have some warning and take action to raise your blood sugar.

Getting the endo to listen was difficult. I came prepared with a list of reasons why I thought I may have Mody but she was still hesitant about it, saying it is rare. 

Since I was misdiagnosed as type 1, What we did first was we did a test with all the type 1 antibodies to rule out autoimmune, and also a c peptide test to see if my body was producing insulin. 

It came back my body was making a small amount of insulin, and no antibodies. That gave her enough reason to prescribe the genetic test, which came back positive.

Originally I thought I had Mody 3 because it is more severe and gets misdiagnosed as type 1 more frequently, however, different mutations may have different severities, and I just happened to have one of the most severe Mody 2 mutations possible.

1ko28rt,msnx1ag,podilymbus,2025-05-16 17:57:55,"First of all, I am so sorry that you are going through this. I saw so many people posting about this on r/gestationaldiabetes when I was pregnant, you are not alone and I wish providers were more aware of this issue. I have some ideas/suggestions/things you should know that I will list, I don’t know what you already know so sorry if some of it is redundant.
1) Gestational diabetes has stricter targets than Type 2 and also is harder to manage because insulin resistance gets progressively worse as the placenta grows. Perfection is pretty much impossible because you have moving goal posts. 
2) It is not your fault, and again, perfection is not possible for most people’s blood sugar control. Especially if you need insulin.
3) If you can, ask to have your care managed by an MFM (maternal fetal medicine specialist). They will have way more time and attention to devote than an OB or endocrinologist 
4) Unfortunately, you are probably going to have to do a lot of self advocacy. People see “diabetes” and they often falsely assume that you overeat or have poor eating habits. Your new mantra needs to be “I am growing a baby and I need to make sure that I am getting adequate calories and nutrition for my health and my baby’s health”. Say it over and over to yourself and every healthcare provider who is managing your diabetes. 
5) Growing a baby takes a massive amount of energy and you need to be able to eat. Yes, you might need more insulin so you can eat more. There is nothing wrong with that and if your care providers act like there is repeat the mantra above. They might be overly cautious about insulin due to the risk of hypoglycemia. Make sure to ask about that and how to treat it so that they know you take it seriously and know what to do.
6) I second the suggestion to see a dietitian who specializes in eating disorders. They might even be able to make a custom meal plan for you so you don’t have to do the carb counting yourself. 
7) There are also some meal delivery services that make diabetic-friendly meals, my aunt signed me up for one for the last few weeks of my 2nd pregnancy and it was really helpful in cutting down on the mental load. 
8) I had two GD pregnancies that were both quite hard to manage (I do not have an ED but it was still hard on my relationship with food), and I now have two healthy children, hopefully it helps to hear that. 
9) You’re already a great mom and any provider who doesn’t recognize that and acknowledge the hard work you are doing to manage this difficult condition is an asshole",2,0.9755
1ko28rt,mspcamh,Perfect_Kitchen_1002,2025-05-16 22:25:04,"Everything you are going through is incredibly tough, and the way you feel about it is completely valid. Please get yourself connected back into therapy to help. This is urgent! 

Much of GDM management runs contrary to your eating disorder recovery. Nutrition is important, and so is the quality of your life. We need both nutrition and mental wellbeing to be healthy. Pregnancy included.

Yes, GDM can be managed with less restriction once insulin is part of your plan. Your insulin needs to be increased, work with your team more than weekly to accomplish this. As your placenta grows, you will need more insulin every week. This is not failure or shaming you for the food you are eating, it’s simply the placenta growing which causes blood sugars to be higher. Your team needs to get the doses right to offset the normal physiology of growing a baby. If your numbers are off, your team needs to know asap so they can help adjust the doses. If they are unwilling to do this and instead shame you for eating, find a new team. 

It’s common to feel a bit beat up in diabetes + pregnancy care. Survived it twice myself, and the shame/guilt/stigma nearly did me in (even though I am a diabetes specialist by training). If you can take a support person/partner to visits, I found that helped a lot. But honestly it’s hellacious.

1knvcb3,mslbakr,albhefpf,2025-05-16 08:18:35,"Oh my goodness my heart dropped reading your post. This is so devastating! Did your mother ever go to an emergency room? It sounds like she was experiencing a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. This is what happens when blood sugars are too high for too long. She needed an IV insulin drip, not a tablet diabetic medicine. It sounds like she was declining slowly undetected, and then quickly over a short period of time which is what happens here.

She was in a clear medical emergency. Everything you are describing is the symptoms of this, which is called DKA. You should seriously look into medical malpractice. Whoever gave her a pill instead of immediately sending her to the emergency room missed very urgent signs. 

I’m serious – please look into medical malpractice because this sounds very suspiciously like DKA symptoms that were ignored. Please note that I am not a medical professional, but I myself experienced DKA and these were the exact symptoms. Having trouble moving and having trouble breathing are two very huge symptoms. Was she also drinking a lot of water, peeing a lot, and possibly nauseous? Did she experience brain fog or confusion during this period?

You should research DKA and see if anything else about her condition in her last days, matches up. Something else that I’m experiencing/reading about a lot in these threads is that type one diabetics also get misdiagnosed as type two. Type two diabetes gets treated like something that is not urgent. DKA in either type of diabetes need an IV trip of insulin immediately, not a tablet drug that is meant to work over a long period of time. Again, not a medical professional, but speaking from my experience and the thousands of posts I have read on this sub. Please do her own research and talk to other professionals.

I’m not sure if you have access to an autopsy, but you might also want to test to see if she had any of the type one diabetes antibodies.

I also want to tell you that you didn’t do anything wrong. You were right to help her get care, but that care may have failed you. If she was indeed in DKA, half a pill or one pill wasn’t the problem. It was that she needed a lot more intervention than what she got.

If this ends up being the case, I hope that having an answer can give you some peace. There are no words right now that can bring any comfort. All I can say is please honor her memory. Sending you the biggest hug! 💙",2,0.9715

I want to share with you a quote from a book that changed my perspective on *everything* when I read it, although I don't know if it will help you as much as it helped me.




> For we each of us deserve everything, every luxury that was ever piled in the tombs of the dead kings, and we each of us deserve nothing, not a mouthful of bread in hunger. Have we not eaten while another starved? Will you punish us for that? Will you reward us for the virtue of starving while others ate? No man earns punishment, no man earns reward. Free your mind of the idea of deserving, the idea of earning, and you will begin to be able to think.

1knv7d1,msn7qsm,HabsMan62,2025-05-16 15:54:57,"So 3 yrs and you still have no idea what “type” of diabetes you have.  That’s very concerning, mostly because of the quality of care you are receiving, and have been receiving all this time.  There is a big difference between T1D and T2D, with the former being an autoimmune disease, and therefore your body has killed off the insulin producing beta cells of your pancreas.  It also opens you up to other possible autoimmune diseases in the future.

Being on insulin doesn’t narrow it down.  So obviously you are an adult, diagnosed a little later in life.  That also doesn’t narrow it down.   

But your daily regimen and schedule of dr appt’s may help.  If you check your bld glucose using a meter about 4-5 x’s a day, especially before meals, or have a CGM, and have an insulin to carb ratio (how many units of insulin per set number of carbs, ie 1:15), with a basal rate, or take 2 shots a day (one short acting, one basal), or just one basal shot - you are most likely a T1D.  

But if your regimen hasn’t changed at all over the past 3 yrs, after having dr visits, and consultation’s with your team reviewing your A1c level and your data, then you could be LADA.  This is a slower progressing form of T1D, with a longer honeymoon period.  

But if you are on of the newer one shot per day Mounjaro or Wegouvy, you could be T2D.

However, if you are a T1D, it seems likely that you would know.  Have you had regular lab work every 4 months to review your progress?  Have you changed your regimen because of lows (possibly extreme lows), or highs that required a correction dose of fast acting insulin?  Have you had a love/hate relationship with how foods impact your bld glucose levels?  As well as heat, sickness, stress, exercise, work, relationships, sex, etc?  Has your bld glucose shot up high, or dropped suddenly?

Believe me you would know if you were T1D.  But seriously, ask.  A c-peptide test will show if and how much insulin your pancreas is producing, and antibody tests can also provide more info.",2,0.4784

1knspuu,msksrfp,MisanthropicScott,2025-05-16 05:16:48,"First, I absolutely love that you're here asking questions and trying to learn more so that you can be more supportive.

Unfortunately, there is not a lot I can really answer for you without knowing more about his treatment regimen. I suspect that what is vibrating in bed is a continuous glucose monitor. But, I can't even be sure of that.

I think the first and best thing you can do to start is to let him know that type 1 diabetes (often abbreviated T1D) is nothing to be ashamed of. None of us *did anything* that caused us to get T1D. It's an autoimmune disease. It is not caused by having eaten too much sugar or any other lifestyle issue. Make sure he knows that you know this. His illness is *not* a personal failing.

If our T1D is well controlled, we can eat whatever we want as long as we take enough insulin for it. Few or likely none of us have perfect control. Most of us will experience highs and lows. They are part of life with T1D. Try not to panic over most of these.

That said, it is important to do our best to manage this.

For right now, I think it's important to simply make sure that he is comfortable treating and managing his diabetes with you there. He should not be hiding this from you. The more comfortable he is talking about it the better.

From there, *if there is an issue with his control* (and I can't really say that there is), you may be able to help him to follow the instructions of his health care team and get in better control.

As he gets more comfortable talking to you, if you're concerned for his safety, you can try to ensure that he never leaves home without glucose tablets or other fast acting snack for lows. You can also ask if he has a glucagon emergency kit and ask him to show you how to administer it if necessary. My wife knows how to do this even though I've never needed one in 36 years.

Again, I really appreciate that you're here to try to learn about this. I really hope you can help him get more comfortable talking about this with you and being more open about his treatment.

Later, you can talk to him about his numbers like A1C and time in range. But, right now, the priority is just to get past this embarrassment.",73,0.9968

1knspuu,mskt3qi,Thiccc-Fil-Ay,2025-05-16 05:19:48,"First, it’s gonna be ok. 
He’s got a monitor and sounds like he’s taking care of his basics. 

One thing you can do is ask him to teach you what all the things mean. The vibrations, the alerts, blood sugar ranges (green/yellow numbers on the app), what you can do in an emergency, or what you can do day to day to support him. Let him know that you want to know so you can support him and not control him. I know you said it threatens his masculinity, but if you frame it in way that makes him feel in control, and you encourage his strength through his challenge, I think that might help. There is nothing easy or weak about living with diabetes, it’s literally life on legendary mode. 


Diabetes is a long term struggle with short term and long term symptoms. What he needs is loving support, but not in a pushy way. Don’t worry about stressing him if you’re approaching his struggles from a place of love. 
If he’s controlling his blood sugars, then he should be able to handle stress just like any other person should. 


As far as healthy food goes, I go high fat and high protein to limit carbs, but as long as blood sugars are good, type 1’s can really eat just about anything as long as they take the correct insulin. High carbs and lots of sugars that would send his blood sugar spiking would be good to avoid, but we all have a craving for a sweet treat every now and then. Encourage sweets that have a nutritional label, so he can accurately measure carbs. If his diet sucks outside of trying to control for diabetes, that’s another convo. 


Learn how to count carbs. It will help you understand the mental burden of each meal, and also will be so helpful if you take note of carb counts when cooking at home. A simple act of making dinner changes into something even more wonderful when you say “I kept track of the carbs tonight, it should be 50 according to the recipe, but I saved the box of you want to double check.”


Tell your mom she’s wrong, and stop worrying about sudden diabetic death at night. To my knowledge, It is not well studied and is most commonly linked to low blood sugar or seizures caused by low blood sugar. For a type one diabetic, this would only happen if they took too much insulin.  This is extreeeeeemly rare. 



Some things to practically consider…
1. Is he open to sharing his blood sugars with you? If he does, you can’t criticize if they’re bad, only offer support. We all have bad days and rollercoaster seasons with blood sugars. Most apps have a sharing feature. 

2. Sugar Pixle. Know what’s going on without asking, even in the middle of the night. Look it up. 


3. Keep emergency sugar around. It’s such a thoughtful thing and can make a bad situation so much better. My partner kept smarties in her purse even though I always had sugar on me. The one time I didn’t and she did… she got so kissed.",19,0.9923

Sweating is a common symptom of rapid glucose changes. Irritability and withdrawal + hunger sounds like low glucose. 

You can live a healthy life with t1d. I've had it for over 30 years and I was diagnosed very young.

1knspuu,msl2zv0,regionalatbest,2025-05-16 06:52:38,"Totally agree that the main issue is his embarrassment surrounding his T1D. The social construct of masculinity aside, there are plenty of traditionally masculine dudes with T1D. Like, there are some manly-ass T1D influencers that I’ve seen on my For You Page. I feel problematic saying that lol, but also, I think it’d be easier for him to see that it really doesn’t change your masculinity, rather than try and convince him that masculinity doesn’t matter and he shouldn’t care. One step at a time, yaknow?


I’m guessing the box in his pocket is actually his insulin pump, and he could’ve called it a glucose monitor bc of insecurity (like, maybe people ask more questions when he says it’s a pump, or he feels like an insulin pump threatens his masculinity even more???). If he’s using his phone to check his blood sugar, he probably wouldn’t be using another receiver with the same readings. Or, maybe it was a manual glucometer, which is always good to carry around in case the continuous monitor fails. 


The vibrating doesn’t necessarily mean his glucose control is out-of-wack, and even if it does, he could be having a rough week and that’s OK. Tandem brand pumps especially LOVE to vibrate, whether it’s for a bluetooth signal loss, glucose alert, site change alert, battery, etc. I’ve definitely had days where mine annoys the hell out of me because it’s one alert after another and I just want to sleep. 


Others have also given really good advice, a lot of this does require communicating with him, but I also think it’s really good you came here to hear from others who are more open to talking about it. r/Type1Diabetes and r/diabetes_t1 could also be good to just scroll through and learn from :-)",3,0.9879

If he saw you being sick, I'm sure he would run out and get you medicine so too. When he's dealing with this, there's ways you can help that shouldn't stress him out. 
It is something I found very worrying when I was a teenager and I would be very self-conscious of where when I would take my insulin and especially how many people knew. For instance, I worked in a bank for 10 years and I never once told anyone. I was diabetic simply because I didn't want them to constantly comment on what I was eating. One guy did find out as I had to tell him when he borrowed me a Red Bull and vodka that I couldn't drink the Red Bull which was kind of funny at the time. But even he when he saw me eating a biscuit or a donut would be like ""Hey. Can you eat that?"" In front of people, which makes you incredibly self-conscious about who knows what and what they're going to say. 


I'm guessing your boyfriend is a little bit the same way. He definitely doesn't like correcting comments aimed at him because a lot of people seemed think that any type of sugar will kill us. Unfortunately, there are a lot of uneducated people about diabetes and don't understand that we need to control our blood sugar and not that we need to cut sugar out entirely. Also, people don't understand carbohydrates also affect our bloods and we'll say things like ""hey, why don't you just eat bread?"". 

It's Grace you want to get involved. I would say if he has a bit of anger issues that's not your fault. If you're a part of his life you need to know what's going on. So talk to him and lay it out that he needs to open up and fill you in on what works for him. What doesn't and how you can help or not help but you need to know what's going on with him. My girlfriend took a lot of initiative on this as well. She always asks me what my bloods are. She buys whole grain foods. She might say the odd, weird comment that does irritate me, but that's no big deal and it's nothing to fly off the handle about and I explain as best I can to her why I'm eating chocolate at 4:00 a.m. sometimes and she understands it is necessary and I'm not just over indulging",2,0.8896

General advice.

Reserve a spot in the fridge for any diabetic supplies. And a spot on a counter too. Nothing else goes in those spots.

If he weighs his food at home to calculate, buy a kitchen scale for your home. Don't mix up leftovers together, even if they're served together. Say mashed potatoes and green beans.

Dismissing irritation as ""that's your diabetes making you like that"" is as dismissive as ""you're acting like that because you're on your period.""

Have emergency recovery snacks available at home.

Not to put too fine a point on it but your mom is full of shit and your trust in her medical knowledge is hurting both you and your beau.

Stress is associated with the release of cortisol, which prepares the body for action at short notice - and a part of that is raising blood sugar levels.  That's the *exact opposite* of the very rare ""dead in bed"" syndrome, which is most likely due to extreme hypoglycaemia (and requires a whole bunch of other factors to come together in exactly the wrong way at the same time).

> I try suggesting healthier food options when we’re together, but I worry about coming off as controlling or “mothering” him.

""Healthier"" is absolutely not a synonym for ""easier to control blood glucose with"".  More than a bit of fruit salad is goddamn kryptonite, yet is generally seen as ""healthy"".  Even the latest, fastest-acting artificial insulins can't come close to endogenous insulin that gets directly into the bloodstream to allow that rush of sugar to be processed.  Fats/oils are a very useful diet component to get absorption of carbohydrates to more closely match the action of artificial insulins better - for example, I happen to find ice cream to be one of the easier foods to bolus properly for as the fat stretches out the impact of the sugars.  But nor am I going to touch the stuff on a daily basis.

> He lives alone and eats out frequently — often oily meals — and he always needs a sweet treat after eating, usually chocolate.

Chocolate is a *terrible* choice when needing something sweet in T1Dland: it has a lot of fat to slow down absorption of the sugars as I have mentioned.

> So I’m reaching out here for guidance. Based on what I’ve shared, do you think his diabetes seems poorly managed? Is there anything I should be doing differently as his partner? How can I better support him while respecting his space?

You've said you see green numbers and sometimes yellow ones.  That's entirely normal for anything but *really* well-managed T1D.  You've said he drinks a lot of water which is fine, let your kidneys kick back and take it easy.  You've said he can soak his shirt with sweat, which unless it has some mundane explanation is something I only do when I have a *really* bad bout of hypoglycaemia.  Maybe he just sweats a lot every now and again though - there are no shortage of non-T1D explanations for that.

From your description it sounds like you both have a bunch of issues: he is wrapped up in some weird ideas about masculinity and seems ashamed of having T1D so probably would benefit from some therapy about those; you seem to be tentatively concluding things about his T1D and its management on the basis of not very much information and some disinformation you've not been able to identify as such; and you have a relationship problem in that you want to help him manage his T1D in whatever way you can at the same time that he's trying to hide it all from you as much as he can, and it sounds like you're coming to internet strangers about it before coming to him since you don't report the outcome of such a conversation.  And to top it off you're afraid to do an incredibly normal bit of leaning on him in case you kill him by accident.

Talk to him.  Tell him that you see a long-term future with him.  Tell him what you're afraid of.  Ask him what you should be doing given specific circumstances that he lays out (particularly ""oh dear, I appear to be unconscious"" circumstances).  Ask what he'd like you to do for him that might make managing T1D a tiny bit easier.

Be prepared for the answer to be ""nothing at all"".  And to be honest, you should have zero expectation that it'll add up to very much: T1D is a chronic illness characterized by the need to micromanage across a huge number of dimensions: things such as stress, exercise type and duration, food amounts and types, whether one is fighting an infection, time of day, insulin types, insulin dosages, insulin dosage timings, crappy infusion/injection sites, [etc etc etc](https://diatribe.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/42factorsexplainedoctober2019.pdf).

Nobody can tell that I'm starting to feel some symptoms of a blood sugar excursion (and therefore might want to do a glucometer reading to check what my CGM is telling me) except for me.  I share my CGM (continuous glucose monitor) readings with Mrs toasters, who will prod me if it's the case that we're apart and it's blaring a low alarm at her that doesn't seem to have been addressed yet or if I'm all groggy in the middle of the night because I'm a heavy sleeper (and false ""compression"" lows just mean that I rolled over a quarter hour ago), I trust her carb-counting abilities to say that this lasagna she made is XYZ carbs so I can work the details out on the basis of what fraction of it I have, and she carries a glucagon kit with her and knows how to use it and that's about it for her involvement.  Not because of any unwillingness, just that that's about as much as is possible if you're not going to be going the whole hog 24/7 control of environment, activity, food, insulin etc etc that no-one who has T1D wants someone else to do unless they're either 5 or in a coma.

Oh, but do see if he'll explain his glucagon kit to you.",1,-0.6955

1knspuu,msreyu8,anynormalman,2025-05-17 07:51:09,"This seems like it might be counter to others here, but as a man with T1D, I think i can share a perspective for your BF. 
On one level, its great that you care about this and want to learn more. Asking him to explain some things might be helpful in letting him share with you. 
On a more general level, he is an adult and he is probably not looking for a nurse or mother. With respect, offer him support and care that he ASKS for but don’t make attempt to make his condition your responsibility. 
Perhaps think if the roles were reversed and your BF was constantly trying to question your menstrual cycle. Sure, a well timed tampon or some extra affection as a low point might sound nice, but if he was constantly trying to monitor your cycle, asking you questions about it, telling you to eat certain foods, how stress and your weight can affect your cycle, etc it would stop feeling so nice. Any time there is a hint from him that your cycle is the reason for your behaviour would be maddening. You probably know when/if that’s the case, and it’s patronising and infantilising to have someone else do that. The same is true for him and his diabetes. 

I have people in my life that I know care about me a lot, but it nearly always annoys me when I get “how’s your diabetes going?”. 
There are 2 aspects of someone wanting to help me that actually feel helpful; 
1) When she first said, “hey, I’m worried that I won’t know how to help you if there is an emergency. Can you help me understand what to look for and when do something?” That’s someone expressing genuine concern, not just general curiosity or some superficial care. It also meant I didn’t need to try to educate her on all the details of my disease. I explained that the external symptoms of a severe hypo or hyper, and how to make sure I can treat myself, and that barring that (think i’ve passed out or something) the best thing is to call an ambulance and to *not* try to administer my meds for me at that point.
2) Never asking me what my numbers are or if I have taken care of myself in some way, but silently keeping some candy and granola bar in her bag for me as a backup. 

All the things other people are saying about the need to have good communication and such are still good advice, but its his body, his choice, his responsibility. Especially if he feels ashamed of it, then your best approach is simply treating him like he doesn’t have it. Only talk about it if/when he brings it up.",1,0.9981

Early on when all the tech wasn’t yet available, it was a harrowing journey. He had to track his glucose and administer insulin sometimes, all with trembling hands. He tells me things are so much better now with the continuous monitoring devices that also administer mini doses of insulin, compared to the ones he had to take as a youth.

As his girlfriend, I commend you, OP, for your kind concern. I can also say that highs and lows can cause what seems like edginess or meanness in my brother.

Your CGM measures glucose in your interstitial fluid - fluid found in the spaces between cells and blood vessels, but not in the capillaries.  So there will always be a difference.  Your glucose meter is your most accurate.  CGM is often lower than your BG meter.

Think of both as tools.  I love my CGM (Freestyle Libre 3 Plus).  It helps me to understand how different foods affect my BG.  How different exercises affect me.

Dose makes the real difference. I don't know if your dose constitutes high or medium or low, but the level determines how hard it's pushing your pancreas. Could be your dose presents some percentage risk in 10 years, or in 30 years...so all your doctor about the relative risk. 

You should have a backup glucose meter with test strips. CGMs sometimes give out early. You can always test with a meter to see where you are at any one time. 

Your numbers sound high. Your real number over time is the A1c, giving a decent indicator of how you're doing over the last few months. You really want to be at or below 6, which means glucose in the range of 1-teens with post-meal highs in the upper 100s into the 200s of too many processed or too-accessible carbs, like pasta or rice.

When I have a GCM going I will watch what happens after eating this or that. Rice drives me up into the 200s for a few hours even, so not much rice for me anymore. Day-old rice that gets fried (ie properly prepared fried rice) has a lower glycemic index, so the same amount will have less impact coz the sugars re-forms to less-accessible carbs. Upshot is, start becoming aware of what food does what to your glucose, them shoot for more foods with less impact. 

The downside of the GCM is you're always watching ""the number"". You need to live your life, but you _do_ need to learn about the foods you should eat to keep your numbers down. You really want to aim to lower your A1c. The numbers on the GCM though can get really depressing...an unhealthy fixation, which increases stress, which oddly enough can actually worsen your diabetes. That's why I rarely use them. I would if I were a brittle diabetic, or type 1, but some of my darkest times were when I fixated on ""the number"".

Sorry, man...the iced coffee is not a good idea, unless you can ditch the sugar for a different sweetener. I love an SB bottled mocha, with a bit of sugar-free caramel syrup for flavor, but that damn thing spikes my numbers, so only do that on a cheat day once in a great while.

Greatest were fruit and rice. I thought apples were ok in any amount - turned out I can have max 2 per day and on different occasions. White rice! I thought any kind of grain is good - turned out rice is as bad as white bread. In fact, it turned out any kind of grain is to be eaten carefully, even lentils and buckwheat. I like lentils btw.

Speaking of bread - I love bread and I found some kinds of bread (rye bread with bran, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds and rye bread with cumin) which don't cause me spikes if consumed in reasonable amounts. Turned out I am satisfied with reasonable amounts.

Eggs&sausage for breakfast - my favorite breakfast, especially if I add some beans.

I can eat cucumbers in any amount, so they became my main kind of snack along with nuts (I love nuts!). Need to be careful with nuts though due to then being high calorie food.

Last, but not least - meat! I can live without sugar but I can't live without meat!

So, eating with diabetes is pretty easy - eggs and sausage in the morning with a piece of bread, cucumber or tomatoes or nuts for snacks, soup for lunch, meat&veggies for dinner. Soy sauce is safe. Careful with milk in coffee - prefer cinnamon and that is basically it!

Whole foods are better than processed goods [Google for more info].   
If it is in a single serving wrapper [convenience food] it is probably bad for you. Examples - Cookies, Twinkies, chips, etcetera.   
Eat in moderation especially the carbohydrates.  
Fast food tip - Get the 2 egg McMuffin deal and a drink separately instead of a combo meal. Then remove one set of the buns and slap the 2 McMuffins together. That makes a double decker McMuffin but with the carbohydrates of one McMuffin and you skipped the hash brown which is all carbohydrates. The same trick works for all of the sandwiches.  
Apply the above thinking to eating at home or restaurants. When we have burgers at home I eat mine with a fork instead of a bun. Pile veggies on the patty to help fill you up.

I’ve seen others in this sub mention (haven’t tested it myself) that doing some weight training before or after can help mitigate this type of spike. You might try searching the sub for weight training and see what comes up, I know there have been some pretty knowledgeable posts about it but unfortunately don’t remember when I saw them or who wrote them.

I will say that the big picture positive effects of your walks outweigh the negatives. While the walk may temporarily raise your sugar, it sounds like you’re staying in range and it’s very likely that these walks are improving your numbers overall. Exercise can improve stability and help lower numbers in general (improving A1c) in addition to the cardiac and other health benefits. It can even improve/lower the impact of things like dawn phenomenon.",2,0.9822

What I'm trying to say is it will take more than a few walks. As for spiking after walking I'm assuming your body is working hard to bring your levels back to a normal range so fully expect them to be raised. I guess that's why it's not recommended to work out before a GP appointment.

Now I'm not trying to pull you down for actually making an effort in fact quite the opposite that is solid effort walking that distance most people wouldn't do it. I would say I'm testament to the consistency of walking albeit I'd add a heavy ass weight session in-between my walks but I walked to the gym (4.15km) then an hour working out heavy then a walk back (another 4.15km) in 3 months between blood tests my A1C down from 97 to 54.",2,0.3291

However, if you walk for an hour and a half -even if it's gentle walking- that's still putting a lot of stress on your body and your liver dumps glucose into your system because it thinks you're running away from a saber tooth tiger. That is how I found out I was working out too hard. Once I backed off, slowed down, and split my time between 2 walks a day, I did not have the spike problem anymore. I also make sure I don't have insulin on board before I walk. If you're a type one and you keep dropping during exercise make sure you don't have a lot of insulin on board before you go.

What IS necessary is to eat a completely low carb diet until your bg is back in the normal human range (70-120).  Takes a week or so.

Best foods are any kind of meat, fish, lobster, steamed clams, cheese, nuts, seeds, veggies, mushrooms. You will learn to hate carby foods that take a long time to digest (pasta, pizza).   Very dark chocolate is a decent sweet in moderation.      Drink dry wine and liquor freely but beer is terrible (except for the wicked low carb beers).

Eat nothing processed.   Greens and meat are your friend.    So are peanut butter (the ones with only and only peanuts in it )  and cucumbers...   Drink only , only water.   Staying hydrated is a priority now.    Eat small, but more.  

If you are already training regularly, meal prep are an easy cheat code ;).   It also mean you already have the discipline to fight this.   It take some time to adjust your meal, dieticians are your  friends ;)

Sweat the sugar out.   Cardio, walking on incline does magic to burn sugar down and drop very quickly your need of insuline.    Cardio has different use depending on what you want.   You need to monitor your sugar level before, during and after exercise to see what is going on.   And planned accordingly.  

Keep track of what you eat ,  on a sheet, And mostly how it affect you.   This will help you learn how your body react to sugar and it will make your life easier.  

Carry blood sugar tablets in your pants.    In case you have a low,  these can save your butt and are pretty cheap.  Make sure you have them pretty much everywhere around you.  Including your car.

I can have something like a small chocolate bar or baked goods occasionally without an issue. I don’t have these things super regularly but I do have them regularly enough that I don’t feel deprived/get to the point where I’m having cravings (which makes it harder to stick to a reasonable serving). 

One of the keys for me is keeping my portion small (half to a full serving), and eating something that isn’t just straight sugar. It’s a bit counter intuitive but things like chocolate and baked goods have fat to slow things down which is why they aren’t good options for treating lows. Something like jellybeans or skittles is going to be a lot harder to indulge in and keep your sugars reasonable.

Surprise surprise their lifespan plummeted. It stabilised for those who remained on Okinawa but not for those who moved away. 

Although genetics play the greatest role in health, the scientific fact is that what we put into our bodies also determines the path our lives will take. We all know that, and yet most of us rarely bother to look at the back of a food pack. 

For example, I recently bought a pack of cocktail sausages only to find they contained **10%** added sugar! A so-called “health food” breakfast serial by Kelloggs had an astounding **18% added sugar**. 

Ketchup? Try almost 30% sugar. 

And on and on and on.

Unfortunately I had three heart attacks in February of this year caused in very large part by completely asymptomatic severe type 2 diabetes coupled with undiagnosed hypercholesterol, both of which are genetic traits in my family and had clogged up my arteries. Several of my father’s cousins in America (were Irish and our family is gigantic) had these conditions and dropped dead before they were 50. I was exceptionally lucky and didn’t need a second warning re life changes. The Guinness had to go! :)

Average weight my entire life, rarely ate junk food, never drank sodas, had been an athlete throughout my 20s. Yet I was days or weeks away from instant death. I was kept in hospital for 5 more days after triple stent surgery because they simply could not get my blood sugar down, most likely because it had been staggeringly high for so long. Bear in mind I’m only 46. 

Hence my more extreme conversion where diet is concerned. And it’s probably saved my life, according to my consultant. 

On my last night in hospital (as I’ve said here several times) I was placed opposite a man aged about 50 who’d just had his leg amputated due to diabetes. He weighed about 300 pounds and sat in his bed literally joking about his leg stump dripping blood all over the floor while phoning his wife to request she bring in a family-sized bag of M&Ms, Big Mac Meal and large regular Coke. She did. I actually thank him now for being my turning point. 

While I understand that most people would prefer a moderate/slower approach, I personally couldn’t see any point. About 45 days after diagnosis and discharge I had my endocrinology update meeting at which my consultant was so surprised at my progress he asked what I’d been doing. Well I’d lost 14 pounds in weight and almost completely eradicated quick-release carbs from my diet. Every single thing I ate was a whole food other than mayonnaise- I couldn’t give that up. It was unimaginably hard work but with the result that my glucose was now normal. I was taken off insulin and put on a dose of metformin. For the 9 days I was in hospital my evening glucose levels were regularly over 20 mmol/l. Now it’s often so low I don’t take the metformin. I’m rarelt hungry, have lost my craving for carbs, and don’t even think about them. Again- it was incredibly hard to get here but now the change is permanent. 

I spoke to another sub member a few days ago who had an equally dramatic reaction and result. He’s lost 28 pounds in weight and is aiming for diabetic remission. 

The path I chose isn’t for everyone and that’s absolutely fine- this isn’t a competition. The only person I’m competing with is myself. But it works. 

The important thing, I believe, is we both agree that what’s put into our food (almost always without our knowledge) is appalling. Jars of pasta sauce with colossal added sugar, same for our bread, etc etc. The average American now eats more than **22 teaspoons of added sugar per day!**. They consume more added sugar and salt in one month than their ancestors did in an entire **year** back in the 1920s. 

While I can’t change my genetics, I can change what I put in my body. And that’s an absolutely gigantic power which we all have. We need a complete re-education in the west where diet is concerned.

But I can assure you, if you can maintain absence from it it will go away 

I’ll give you an example. I stop drinking soda in 1997. The first year was horrible fighting those urges 

The next year after that, I got a little easier 

And then by the fourth year, no more cravings at all it took four years to remove those cravings 

Now what I ended up doing my uncle taught me to use Perrier water with crystal light Hawaiian punch. This is back in the 80s and 90s so they didn’t really have that sugar-free stuff yet.
So to mix a juice with it also orange juice or whatever with the Perrier add a 70 or 80% Perrier and 30 or 20% juice 

And drink that instead of soda, whenever I have the urge for soda and it worked, it was all about the carbonation 

And then one year I accidentally drank a soda, grabbed it by accident, and it was the most vile thing I ever tasted

I spit it back out, but I haven’t touched soda since pretty much 1997 


I wish I could say the same thing with sugar and processed carbs, but I do know I have to force myself to go longer longer so each time I abstain from eating that stuff I go longer and longer without eating it it’s trial and error. Don’t get me wrong who doesn’t love a good pizza.

You *can’t* ignore it, and I *won’t* run from it.

Yeah, I’ve got it. And the past year? A total car crash.  
Doctors blamed my age. I say — bring it on.

Every morning, I tell myself this:

**I’ve got this.**  
It’s not easy — it’s brutally hard. The drain is real.  
But I pace myself. I *know* how to manage this beast.

A bad day? Not a failure. The only time I fail…  
is when I stop trying. And that’s *not* today. Not ever.

Perfection? Forget it. Not every day will be gold — and that’s OK.  
Stress less. Do your best. That’s the win.

I focus my energy on what *matters*:  
Planning forward. Powering up. Learning from the good days — and stacking more of them.

Because I’m not just surviving this.  
**I’m owning it. One day. One battle. One victory at a time.**

This sub can be biased, since most of us are here because we're working hard to keep our condition under control, but we also get the secondhand posts from people who have a loved one with diabetes who isn't taking care of themselves because they just don't care to, or they're in denial, or whatever the situation may be. The reality is that's a huge percentage of the diagnosed population. Even those of us who are putting in the work deal with burnout and periods where we're not sticking to it like we know we should. 

I know a lot of doctors provide minimal information with an initial diagnosis, and I think it's because they know if they overload someone with a ton of stuff up front, they're more likely to just ignore it or get overwhelmed and give up before they even start. *You're diabetic. Wear this monitor that'll track your blood sugar every minute of the day, and then when you come back in we can look over it and I'll be able to see how bad you've been doing* isn't an appealing proposition.

My doctor didn't even recommend a glucose monitor at first, she just told me to start taking my meds and gave me suggestions about diet changes and exercise, and then the next time I came in we got more into it. 

If she had said ""You need to get a glucose monitor and test yourself when you wake up and before and after every meal, and you need to get a CGM to track how different foods affect you, and you need to start taking these different supplements, and you need to look into these resources and read up on the glycemic index and resistant starches, don't forget about dawn phenomenon, and...""

1klw3nr,ms5m127,breebop83,2025-05-13 20:36:31,"For the exact reason you mentioned. A lot of insurances won’t pay for patients who aren’t insulin dependent to get a CGM which makes them cost prohibitive for a lot of patients. 

In the US most CGMs still require a prescription (I think there is 1 OTC option now and I think there are more in the works). Because a prescription is required I *believe* the doctor’s office still has to go through all of the initial paperwork to submit it to insurance even if you’re willing to pay out of pocket. My understanding is that it has to be denied before a patient can forgo insurance, this generates some extra work for the doctor’s office for something they know will be declined. 

My mom is a T2 and it was a whole thing for her to get a Libre even though she knew it would be denied by insurance and was willing to pay for it out of pocket. 

I was recently out of the hospital from DKA coma when I got my first CGM and it still took 4-6 weeks  of pre authorization crap for me to get approved and that was with pretty awesome insurance. This was several years ago so I’d hope the process is a bit easier/faster now.

Someone new who doesn’t understand it all could be overwhelmed by the constant alarms and upkeep of having a CGM combined with understanding how their diabetes works based on their particular environment. 3. CGM’s operate on interstitial fluid, not blood.

In addition to paying for the sensors at a really reduced rate and billing at the government reimbursement  price, where they probably make money, they have to scale up the AI and the communication network for data input from the user to analyze and use the data.

I think browsing the Mounjaro subreddit will have some conversations over there on what to eat, especially when you and your husband are struggling to eat. I will say protein shakes are often the saving grace with getting protein while on MJ, but also having smaller, high protein and high fiber snacks throughout the day instead of meals helps too. 

Does your family like more plant based proteins (often high in fiber too) like lentils, seeds, peas, beans and chickpeas? Those are easily incorporated into so many dishes. Roasted and seasoned chickpeas themselves make great snacks. If you all like ground beef, lentils are often added to stretch what you have and have bonus fiber added. Cheese and nut butters also are high protein. A simple cheese and veggie sandwich with a spread like hummus or cream cheese on a multigrain grain bread or wrap can be really delicious and high protein and fiber. Cheesy bean and veggie quesadillas or burritos can be a nice option as well.

Now forgive my metaphors because I speak in old timey sayings... It sounds like your doctor is suggesting you kick the can (stress) down the road instead of helping you pick the can up and finding a better way to carry it. 

Based on your post, it sounds like you're going to be in this same exact boat once the honeymoon period is over. Imo it might be better to address the stress itself as a problem instead of essentially ignoring another problem(diabetes) that is going to be tougher to deal with if it's not managed. 

If it helps, I can assure you that diabetes does become easier to manage with time, a good routine, and a decent diet. Figuring out the right diet and routine for you will require some trial and error. You'll also need to adjust insulin ratios which can be discouraging, but once those are figured out it's almost like being a completely normal person. You just have to manually take insulin instead of your body naturally producing it 😉

Mine were kind of all over the place during my teens! Talk to your doctor if you notice this happening to see if there's anything they can adjust with your insulin to help you. Not sure on your gender, but if you get periods you may need to adjust your insulin slightly(again discuss with your doctor) around that as well. I haven't clocked a difference during my periods now as an adult(32F), but I wouldn't doubt they skewed my numbers as a teen. Lastly, certain *ahem* hormal activities can cause your blood sugars to drop pretty quickly... I keep a juice box on my nightstand for this and the occasional middle of the night low(CGM has helped with these). 

Diabetes is going to be a lot and it's a little different for everyone. Don't beat yourself up (especially in the beginning!) if things get tough. Just do the best that you can! If that means taking a step back because of anxiety, that's okay! Just be safe :) Best of luck!!!",1,0.9908

The best readily available tests are simultaneous fast INSULIN and fasting glucose to calculate your HOMA-IR (Insulin resistance) score and a Kraft insulin response test (basically a 5 hour OGTT with insulin reading, not just glucose.

I have heard the claim that 99% of PCPs virtually never order any insulin lab work. With the knowledge available to day, that should be considered gross negligence, malpractice.

Measuring and tracking changed in Insulin resistance can give indications of impending harm 10-20 years ahead of the damage, far in advance of diabetes, heart disease, dementia and cancer.

Insulin resistance can be reversed and insulin sensitivity restored. According to Ben Bikman the 3 primary drivers of insulin resistance are 1) crap carb overload and extended eating and snacking, 2) stress and 3) systemic inflammation.

You have obviously moved the needles, so you seem to be on the right track. The renown Dr. Paul Marik, an intensive care specialist, cured his diabetes of over 20 years by ""accident"" while he was experimenting on himself to effect relief from covid spike effects. His plan was to stimulate the body's innate healing and repair process called autophagy. And he was stunned that in less than 3 months he was no longer diabetic.

He tells his story here:

[https://odysee.com/@FrontlineCovid19CriticalCareAlliance:c/Weekly\_Webinar\_September14:d](https://odysee.com/@FrontlineCovid19CriticalCareAlliance:c/Weekly_Webinar_September14:d)

Bottom line, don't rely on HbA1c alone. Track your level of Insulin Resistance. Know your HOMA-IR score.  
  
My HbA1c was rather normal, maybe occasionally into the ""prediabetic"" range. But I learned that for decades my glucose had been kept in check by extreme insulin levels. and those elevated insulin levels tend to damage arterial walls, leading to plaque buildup. Who knew? My BP was always good, even ""low"", Hence I was shocked when a CTA scan showed significant plaque buildup. Had my doctors been doing their job and monitoring my insulin levels, I could have known I was heading for that a couple decades ago, plenty of time to change my eating habits and learn stress management techniques.",2,-0.902

As I understand, the distinction between prediabetes and type 2 is in the diagnostic criteria. I could be wrong about that and invite corrections.  So unless your doc is saying you were misdiagnosed, you still have type 2. Type 2 can improve and even go into remission, but I don't think it can  become pre.

Also there is very little difference in treatment, except for medication. The recommended lifestyle changes are almost identical. People with prediabetes have nearly as much at risk for complications as people with type 2. Some actually have complications at diagnosis.

Dr. Marik relied significantly on the advice and guidance of Dr. Robert Lustig, a pediatric neuro-endocrinologist, whose research indicates that most of the chronic diseases that are increasing so much in the USA and around the world are primarily forms of ""processed food disease"", here speaking at the University of Michigan:

When it comes to managing your numbers, the better you are at avoiding sugars and carbs, the better your numbers should be.   But everyone is different. You will have to learn for you and your body what you can and can not eat safely.   Some people can have pasta, and some people can have pizza.  We all are on this journey, and we have to learn as we go.  Some of us were born this way, so it's just normal.   Some of us have gradually migrated into this... and some of us have Autoimmune issues...  You will make mistakes, but use your CGM as a tool.. take notes on your app (if you can) the more detailed the better in the long run.  So you can reference... (Fictious Example) today I had Papa John's Pizza, while the pizza was fine, I realized their sauce has high sugar content, there for the combination of bread (dough) and their sauce, created a spike.  Yesterday I had Domino's Pizza and their sauce does not contain high amounts of sugar, so while pizza isn't a great option,  it means that if I want to eat pizza,  I need to have lots of toppings (veggies and meats) and it has to be from Domino's.   This isn't a real scenario, I am just trying to help you understand what some of the challenges you will face.  Certain things are definite triggers for spikes, when you realize that, make notes, mentally and physically.   The thing that caused the spike is normally concerned a bad thing, however,  if your numbers are low and you don't have medicine close, that thing that was perceived as bad because it caused the spike may be a help to bring your numbers up fast.

Some carbs don't produce much of a reaction, others give a massive spike for the same number of carbs. It's incredibly frustrating, depressing, and it usually doesn't make much sense given a lot of the information we're given.

The CGM will help you start to understand what happens with foods, exercise, medications, and sleep, and while some things you can't ""fix"" (like my body will almost always spike over 200 mg/dl right before waking up after spending most of the night in the 100-150 range), it will just help you understand the trends. For instance, at least once a week, I'll have oatmeal with a tablespoon of brown sugar and some half and half for breakfast. My reading spikes way up quickly, but comes back down much faster than if I have pasta or rice. 

Give it and the Jardiance time. Track what you eat for a few weeks and watch what happens and share some of those trends and questions with your doctor and endocrinologist and nutritionist if you have one available to you. And I hate to say it, but your body's response to foods and medications is likely to change over time, as well. I was diagnosed almost 15 years ago, and it's just been an ever-evolving journey. What worked in terms of diet and treatment 14 years ago doesn't work as well now. But don't give up! It's okay to be frustrated, but just keep working to find other ways to attack it. 

Given your phobia, I'd advise you to try to do the finger pricks a couple of times a week for a while just to see how far off the CGM readings are (I use a Freestyle Libre 3 and I've found that for me, it's usually only off by 2-5%). And I've noticed when I switch arms with the CGM, I'll get different numbers too (my left arm is consistently about 5 points lower than the right, go figure).

I would stay away from smoothies from stores because they load them with sugar much like the coffees that people spend $8 on from coffee shops. Personally for me, I get better nutrition and a happier gut because I drink smoothies and the small raise in BG is outweighed by the benefits I get.

I was constantly failing to test my blood sugar regularly because the finger-pricks are far worse than the insulin shots, as we all know.
And I work with my hands and needed the feeling in my fingertips, so I started researching alternate site lancets and came across the genteel droplet in 2018ish?

It looked too good to be true, and it was $70, and that was just a bit too much for me, so I kept it in the back of my mind that I was going to wait for a sale

Several weeks later, while restocking on test strips at the Walmart Pharmacy, I looked on the Shelf and tucked away a box that said Genteel Droplet, which was only $30. I immediately go, can't be the same device, it's less than half the price, well, my understanding of the situation is that Droplet released their Lansing device and set their price point. Walmart approached them and said We want a more affordable version for our stores, and it is the same exact device, it just didn't come with the extra carrying case in the fancy clip that came in the original packaging.

I immediately bought it, took it home, and was astounded. It really does do what it says.
 Every once in awhile I don't draw enough blood or my finger slips off and I don't make a good seal or I rage stab myself because I'm in a hurry or hangry and it stings just a bit but generally even then less than a regular finger stick and most of the time if any sensation is a mild itch

I took the time several years ago to write up a post about how great it was and how it made managing my diabetes so much simpler because I wasn't avoiding checking my sugar to begin with but when I wrote the post I quickly realized that they no longer were in stock at Walmart and I could not find them in stock online and I was honestly crushed for the community because I was excited to share something that was such a quality of life Improvement for me

I was disappointed I was confused as to why such a good product seem to have disappeared I tracked down the entire product catalog for the Chocolate Company and they removed the Lansing device from their catalog it appears they sold the name rights device something I don't know to another company and you could find listings for the genteel Lansing device no more ""droplet"" but still not one in stock anywhere that I could find or any way to order or even request to a distributor might be so I sadly give up.

I was reading this post and decided to add my experience with my gentle droplet to this post even though I felt it was going to be irrelevant, I still love and use my original to this day but I am very excited to say when I went to Google to pull reference photos and links to share with you guys get one of the first Google results that popped up was in fact:

MyGenteel.com

It appears in 2023, a family with a 5-year-old son nearly diagnosed received a genteel device, and it was such a positive experience for them that they got together with the inventor and the founders, and have since assumed control of the company, and finally, they are available again! 

I highly doubt there is any chance they will see this but for my sake and for the sake of the other diabetics in my life personally I say Bravo and thank you Hammond family for all you have done and will do in the future for our community, thank you for saving a product that appeared to be at least stagnant if not already completely discontinued and unavailable, thank you for sharing your family your story your success most importantly thank you for making a positive and trying to improve the quality of life of others in this community that you did not volunteer for and like the rest of us were unjustly and unexpectedly thrust into. You are inspirational.

I don't post often and I sound like a fan girl right now, but I'm honestly excited..
This was a product developed in 2014 that from what I can tell has already been through three iterations that were just relabeling that is now back and it appears not only is it back it is improved or at least there is a new version personally I cannot tell the difference between the basic and the exclusive that are available on their website except for the basic says it accepts any universal Lancet and the exclusive says it only uses the genteel butterfly lancets.

For Anybody who has personal experience with the new version or has compared it to two side by side, further Insight would be much appreciated cuz I am a nerd for these things.

Yes! This past year I’ve said that a lot.

That‘s not to say that it’s easy or not mentally exhausting sometimes dealing with this diagnosis. I can sometimes fall into “woe is me“ mindset, but I do my best to get out of it as quickly as possible. It usually happens when I think about pizza. LOL

For some, reversal is possible or whatever someone wants to call it. I don’t really care what term is used.

1klab6f,ms36y1e,jimfear998,2025-05-13 13:31:06,"I struggled with the disordered eating bit for a couple years after diagnosis. Carb and calorie counting and eating in heavy deficit until I reached my goal weight, which also induced hair loss, mental fatigue, carb-phobia, and some other stuff. Even when I got to my goal, I wasn't really happy, and my avoidance of carbohydrates had me pretty intolerant of them when I began reintroducing them, which led to bigger spikes, which led to fear, which led to restriction again. 

Then, I had a chat with a physician and a diabetes researcher, who basically laid it out that a glucose spike, provided that your postprandial numbers are good, are a normal response to food, and that even non-diabetics only spend about 90-95% of time in range. I was mad when I wasn't pushing 100% and restricted myself to reflect that. 

Now, I'm still restrictive in a sense, but not to the point where I no longer have enjoyment of eating. I stick primarily to whole foods, eat whatever vegetables I want, whenever I have higher glycemic foods (mostly fruit, sourdough bread, potatoes), I make sure I have adequate protein and fibre to go along with them to soften the blow, and make sure I'm getting both regular exercise, water intake, and sleep (easier with less food anxiety, for sure!). Once I maintained a steady but moderate carb load, my numbers didn't change all that much. Maybe an 8.5, or a 10 if I go out for a heavy meal with friends, but a brisk walk, and it comes back down. 

Obviously, YMMV, medication is a helpful tool, and having some goals in place to get where you want to be is important, but getting there with a ton of stress isn't going to be much help, especially since its a lifestyle change, not a quick fix. It has to be sustainable, and you have to eat every day, so you might as well find some enjoyment in that. 

I've been able to find a balance that's still a pain sometimes, but I can cook and eat a variety of foods that I enjoy, and my A1C has been 4.9-5.2 for 3 years now.

1klab6f,ms145xd,EmmerdoesNOTrepme,2025-05-13 03:16:34,"OP, this would be a thing to reach out to Diabetic Education about, to ask for some help!💖


Personally, I have ADHD (and Autism) along with my Diabetes, and back a couple years after I was diagnosed, I was dealing with a *lot* of stress (lost my job, went back to college, *and* my mom was dealing with multiple health crises that I had to help her navigate through).


I wasn't on a CGM back then, and i'm not gonna lie--the *constant* finger-pokes at mealtime and *having* to write those numbers down was 100% *sending* me into disordered eating patterns & habits.


Not a *full-out* eating disorder, but because it was the *one* thing in my life that *was* ""under my control,"" if I hadn't reached out to my Diabetic Educator, *I WOULD have ended up with one*!


She got me on a CGM (back then, it was the Libre 14-day) saying,


""If *I* worry about the numbers, can *you just scan the sensor* for me, and *ignore them*?""


Honestly?


*That WORKED* for me!  All I do, is make sure my sensor is started (Libre 3+ now), and that my reader is charged (i use the separate reader, because there end up being days where my phone dies, becaumes i forget to charge it at some point).


Then I upload the reader to the Libreview website once every 90 days, *or* just ahead of my appointment with Diabetic Ed (I meet with my current Diabetic Educator once every 4-6 weeks).


And *SHE* ""worries about the numbers,"" while the *ONLY* thing i worry much about, is if I go ""outside the green line"" on my reader (the ""in range"" section).


If i'm low, the reader ""yells at me,"" i have some carbs, then I ""lock it in"" with protein.


If i'm high, I take a bit of my short-acting.


Otherwise *ALL* i worry about, ""Numbers-wise"" is a *quick* glance to see if i'm in-range, i adjust as needed, and *THEN* I *can* ""let it go,"" because i *know* She is there ""to worry about the numbers"" just like my first Diabetic Educator was.


With my ADHD, and with Life as a Diabetic leaving us feeling *so little control* sometimes, ""giving up the worry"" and just *letting* my Diabetic Educators ""deal with the numbers"" makes *all* the difference for me, and definitely keeps me *out* of disordered patterns with food, eating, and meals!

At the time I started both systems had a separate scanning/activation device. I believe both also had a website you could access for more data but the devices really just gave you readings and daily graphs if memory serves. 

Cons of the dexcom for me at the time:

At the time the range was short (20ft) and it required a scanning device. So if you left the scanning device somewhere it lost connectivity quickly and seemed to take forever to reconnect.

I did not like the stomach placement 

Cost has been consistently over $100/month with my insurance (I’ve kept tabs in case I wanted to give it another try). 

I only used Dexcom for a few months so I can’t speak to incorrect readings/technical issues/sensor failures. 

Counterpoints for the Libre

There was still a separate device but you scanned the sensor to see a reading which I actually liked, I’m hypo aware and wake up for lows so no alarms wasn’t really an issue. It held data for 8 or 12 hours so as long as you scanned a few times a day you still had a compete graph. No connectivity issues.

I prefer the arm placement. At the time I switched the Libre was also much thinner and seemed less bulky than the Dexcom (imo). I’ve always worn an over-patch and have never had an issue with sensors ripping off or getting water logged.

Price for a month’s supply has changed from $35 to $75 and back to $35 over the years. 

The last big plus for me is that the Libre sensors last 14 days

This would also contribute to the feeling of urgency — I find with OCD also comes the many issues of, “No, you DON’T get it.” “But you’re not hearing me!” “But what about-“ it’s impossible for me to understand that someone else truly does understand me and what I am saying. This can be as small as explaining why you chose to move a desk, to as big as world politics. Then when you add in ASD, maybe it can be much harder to feel like you’re on the same page as other people — though I don’t have ASD so I can’t speak on that. I do have ADHD and have noticed that when something is thought about for a while, it becomes anxiety provoking. Almost like my brain is so used to distractions that when it can’t utilize one to get over a thought, it’s in instant anxiety mode. 

Basically there’s a stressor; a “sticky thought”. Something your OCD doesn’t want to let go of. That’s the situation surrounding Palestine. Then, there’s the anxiety provoked by CPTSD and ADHD. Then there’s the obsessive and compulsive parts to this. The obsessive part will keep you checking the news, looking at posts online, checking hashtags etc. The compulsive part will keep you ruminating, thinking others aren’t doing enough, caring enough etc etc. 

The only way to break the cycle is to focus on the fact that you are not a bad person to take a break from this content. It is a privilege to be able to step away from someone else’s reality, but you are not a bad person for taking that option. Spend some time thinking of positive alternatives. Whenever you think of Palestine, focus on an alternative. Remind yourself this isn’t about global politics anymore, it’s simply about you and your OCD.

🚩 Emotional instability BEFORE marriage
🚩 Substance abuse escalation
🚩 Paranoid delusions after shrooms
🚩 Verbal abuse
🚩 Complete personality shift

Listen up - this isn't just some ""bad fight."" Your husband is showing classic signs of what could be a substance-induced psychosis or, as his sister suggested, bipolar disorder being triggered by drugs. When someone goes from ""I'll be the best husband ever"" (grandiose thinking) to paranoid delusions about you being hired to steal his money - that's not normal relationship drama, that's mental health crisis territory.

You did the RIGHT FUCKING THING setting that sobriety boundary. But here's the brutal truth: You can't force someone to get help. He's choosing weed over your marriage TWO WEEKS IN. Let that sink in.

Quick action items:
1. Document everything (texts, behavior changes, incidents)
2. Contact a lawyer ASAP (yeah, I said it)
3. Get your own therapist
4. Don't try to fix him - he needs professional help

He should get off weed, and never do shrooms or other rec drugs obvs.  Be caring, listen, but recognize he is in mental distress.

1kpj2yy,msy55o3,kenswiz,2025-05-18 13:02:20,"There’s absolutely nothing wrong with reaching out for help, you’re also an adult and you’re allowed to admit yourself if they won’t provide support. 

If you’re feeling suicidal, need an immediate mental health break, or you’re at risk of harming yourself/others then you should admit yourself. If you’re not feeling that way, I strongly recommend setting up an appointment with a therapist. I think if you’re questioning going, you should go. 

You probably feel scared to tell them because you’re scared of judgement when you’re already struggling. The most you can do is say “I’m struggling with my mental health, I think I need to admit myself into the psych ward for a break and some support.” If they aren’t supportive, tell a friend you’re going and admit yourself.

The pediatric ward is just different with their approach. They’re going to use age appropriate approaches to help you. The adult ward allows you to have more of a “say” regarding your actions and your parents (depending on the circumstances) won’t have anything to do with your care plan or choices. Adult wards tend to allow you to check yourself out after a mandatory hold (in some areas) but they also can offer longer inpatient care.",1,0.8303

for me it started after months of trying to *fix* everything — productivity hacks, caffeine, endless advice threads. i was drowning in “shoulds.” and then one day i just couldn’t anymore. total system shutdown.

what *barely* started helping was getting out of “fix-it mode” and just letting myself suck at everything for a while. no pressure to be normal. just… breathing. moving my body a little. writing things down with zero structure, no goals — just so my head didn’t feel so loud.

eventually i turned that mess into a rough journal thing (still kinda chaotic lol) but weirdly it’s the only thing i’ve stuck with. even if it’s just scribbling “i feel nothing again” for a week straight.

you’re not broken. freeze mode *feels* permanent but it isn’t. the fact that you wrote this shows something in you still wants connection ,that’s huge.

1kpi23x,msy6l7l,ImportantEducator765,2025-05-18 13:11:40,"Holy shit. I was just about to ask about the same thing on r/AskDocs. I'm literally experiencing the exact same thing. It's been 4-5 months for me.

It started with forgetting what I'm doing on my computer, and having to talk myself through on-screen tasks. I thought it was apathy from staying in another non-english speaking country for some time. But about 2 weeks ago I felt that shallowness (I can't explain how really), like I was realizing pieces of me had broken apart and fallen off (inertia?). My musicality, speech vocabulary, etc are all affected. I feel like I've also lost hard-earned memory recollection and critical thinking skills. I had a whole conversation based on a false memory about an incorrect fact, that I believed was true (because I learned about it). I basically misremembered with 100% confidence. It was really f\*cked up when I realized it. The whole thing is really f\*cked up.

Not too long ago I started enjoying my favorite songs again (both sounds and lyrics) and the fog is kinda gone, but I still feel different. I do programming, so I'm just sinking myself into projects and code hoping to reverse whatever happened. Maybe try that, but instead of code do something you did before it started—something you enjoy too. Idk if it will work but for my sake (and yours) I hope so.

  
Question, is you internal clock messed up? Like are you able to tell how long ago you did something (in those 3 months)?",2,0.9642
1kpi23x,msyb5kx,Neat_Toe7235,2025-05-18 13:40:38,"Hi there, I totally feel you and I’m going through the exact same thing. What I usually do is do the things that used to make me happy before entering the shutdown. Although it doesn’t work right away it slowly does, so it takes a while. I started a few days ago and I think it’s starting to work since I experience little cracks of emotions slowly, even though it hard to identify which ones are which, emotions are emotions.

I know it’s hard, trust me I’ve only recently started doing all this but had it on my mind for a while before that. Although I feel nothing from doing the things that would’ve made me happy I still though about what it meant to me.

Other than that maybe try going out for a walk while listening to music or just the sound of nature, look around you and appreciate it. Even if you feel nothing think “I like this, this is beautiful.”

And to finish it off you need to watch out, I’m sure you’ve already experienced this but since your body and mind have been numb for so long emotions will feel weird and alien, feeling emotions will be strange and your mind may want you to go back. Just remember though that your mind adapted to that, and it shouldn’t be a way of life.",1,0.8332

Might have lost my job because of it and now I feel like I am in a vortex of time where it just passes and I am in the same place. I did seek therapy and i am on medication right now. I also do music therapy for certain parts of the day, when i sleep to calm me down, when I wake up to ensure I get out of bed and throughout the day. The silence is lonely but also solitary which has kept me safe. Aside from that, it is good to have a strong support system. Not sure if it is counter intuitive, but my inability to be lucidly productive or think - my friends and family have been there to catch me. It is okay to rely on your most trusted circle, and slowly put yourself back together. I am not there yet either but i believe I will be soon.

Alot of things are happening in the world right now, mental health issues are more prevalent now. I live in Singapore where mental health was never prioritised due to the nature of the work, regional socio economy in this fast paced country/world.

On a more deeper scale, it could be because the topic of death may be uncomfortable and change the mood for a lot of places it’s brought up in. Think about it, our body and mind live and they avoid death, death is something that a lot of us subconsciously avoid whether we fear it or not, that’s why you see a lot of attempted suicide victims try to survive right after, and for those who don’t make it many of them regret it. 

To summarise it, talking about death is less common because our mind and body try to avoid it entirely, that’s why I loved Vinland saga, there was a quote that said “Do we live because we don’t want to die?” And I feel like that’s true. Why bring up a topic that your mind and body fights against. It just naturally feels uncomfortable especially since death is used to inflict pain to others (things like war and crime)",1,-0.9927

although i don’t really have a clear cut solution i just wanted to reassure you that you are not the only person your age who deals with this. what helped me is not sitting alone in my own thoughts for a while, because sometimes that’ll get me to spiral. i also try my best to stay busy and do new things as much as i can to live every moment to the fullest. i’m also on prescribed lexapro but that’s a whole separate thing, that did end up helping with the panic attacks. 

i found that social media and googling things about death can be a huge trigger for it as well for me so i try to ensure my algorithm doesn’t show videos or anything about it, and resisting the urge to look things up that may make me feel even worse.

You don't just quit scrolling; you must reduce it gradually. How many apps do you have on your phone? If you have 4, make them 3; if you have 3, make them 2, and so on. Keep YouTube the last app to delete, and it is okay if you scroll on YouTube when you are trying to quit, because the chance of you watching something educational or something that could benefit you is high compared to other apps. Once you stick with YouTube for a while, feel obliged to delete it and use it when necessary from a browser or from your laptop. Trust me, I have an average of 1 hour screen time a day, and nothing good comes from these apps unless the use is intentional, like try to make a YouTube session where you are allowed to watch a limited number of videos. And no, you don't want to see the news. The only news that matters is you, your family, and the neighborhood you live in.  
  
Try monitoring yourself to see where you use your phone or laptop more often. Do you take your phone to the bathroom? Do you take it with you to bed? Do you use your phone when you are sad? Find the time, place, and emotion that makes you repeat the habit of scrolling and try to reinforce another thing. If you don't feel like doing anything after a long scrolling session, then don't do anything! Try to do nothing for 10 minutes. After time, the act of doing nothing will become fun. Try to watch the sun or take your time making and drinking tea/coffee (yes, make your hobby making tea!), or anything that is not behind a screen. Another thing is to remove all the apps from the screen and keep them in a drawer or a folder. The goal is to make your phone out of distractions.  
  
If you are worried about missing something out from the internet or a meme from a friend on Instagram, try to ask yourself how that pointless thing will add anything of benefit to your brain cells. And if your friends ask why, tell them, ""I am done wasting time."" And if they say you are boring, tell them, ""Maybe."" Don't waste your time arguing when you are trying to fix your life. And if it is really important, then they will text or call you.  
  
And remember, false positivity will make you feel burned out.

1. Enjoy yourself.
2. Give yourself time to stop thinking.
3. Accept that you will not always work.
4. Accept that you can take breaks.
5. Be kind to yourself.
6. Forgive yourself if you made a mistake.

You’re experiencing executive dysfunction, and it occurs when your dopamine/reward system gets hijacked by high-impact, low-sustained activities. Social media is specifically designed to exploit the reward systems, and there are countless legit studies supporting this statement. 

Ibrahim is absolutely correct in how to approach the problem: gradual progress, setting attainable goals, and building mindfulness are the ways to get back in control of that system. 

The most important thing to take away is that it is not a moral failing on your part that your brain fell prey to an insidious (deliberate) manipulation. It’s speaks very highly of you that you want to break the cycle. 

The last bit of critical advice for recovering from this is to redirect the reward system by replacing the scrolling with something you enjoy. I do NOT recommend video games or bingeable shows. Something IRL is best that has a finite duration and a material result: cooking, knitting, woodwork, sculpting, reading books, exercising, and so forth. 

Knowing that your brain is the victim can help contextualize the path to getting control back. 

You got this. ❤️",1,0.9401

I hope and pray that nothing happens to your girlfriend. IF something does, it’s not your fault. She’s hurting and confused and you just can’t control what others do even when you want to so badly. Her family needs to be notified so they can try to keep her safe. Professional help is needed. 

I’m not sure what country you’re in. If you’re in the US, here’s a resource. You should contact them as they have more experience than most of us here.

I have had rheumatoid arthritis since I was a child and multiple sclerosis since I was 24. I'm now 36 years old. 

I don't have a partner, but if I did, I honestly don't think I would risk having (biological) children. Each person feels and thinks differently, depending on how they grew up, and I wouldn't be able to bear the guilt if my child was diagnosed with one of these diseases or another autoimmune disease.

I think it's terribly unfair that I have the pain and enormous limitations that I have, the HUGE fear about my future, the deep sadness of never having been able to have a normal love life, etc. I wouldn't wish this on anyone, much less on my child.

You obviously have endured a lot more than people your age should and have a ton of strength and resilience. Harness that strength inside you and know that you are a beautiful person regardless of your weight.

I'm really glad you're going back to school! I'm in my 30s now, but I was taken out of school to be homeschooled, and it was terrible. I never wanted it in the first place, but my mom gave me no choice in the matter. I was taken out in 3rd grade, and she never once taught me. Then, she would make me feel guilty for not knowing how to teach myself. I had a very traumatic childhood. I fought for myself and put myself in school against her will in high school. It was so hard having to learn everything for the first time because of how much I missed. This will be a great new beginning for you! I hope you make some great friends! I would ask your mom for a doctors appointment where you can talk about your depression. It's VERY important that a professional knows what's going on and can lead you in the right direction. It would be great if you could focus on whatever the doctor suggests and hopefully start therapy! I think it would give you a lot of relief and is just one thing you can do to help the depression. It's always helped me and helped me feel much less alone. 


I would spend the summer trying to work on your depression above losing weight. Starting regular weekly therapy and trying to focus on doing things that bring you joy would be a great start! Anything physical that feels relaxing and fun is always a big help for my depression. I believe in you! This is just the beginning.

I was the same as you. Talk therapy was useless. I  read alot and I knew how to describe my symptoms and use other associated vocabulary. I knew what the problem was but what I didn't know was how to fix it. All I wanted was to know how to fix it. That's it.

Was prescribed a few different anti depressants for anxiety and depression. They weren't really effective and they were also new meds that were ungodly expensive. Not to mention they gave me brain snaps.

It was a frustrating and overall kind of a useless time for me. I wasn't getting better and nothing was working and no I don't need you to help me describe what I'm feeling. Just help make it better so I can function.

I wasn't thrilled at this point but I had a referral to a psychiatrist so I was going to go this appointment and see what this person could do to help me but honestly I didn't have much faith because everything had been bust so far.

This psychiatrist had me sorted in the first visit. I shit you not. I'm still on the medication regimen he prescribed to me back then (dose is just adjusted a bit over the years).

Things are not perfect but damn are they a million times better than they were and I am able to have a life. I can function and deal with shit. 

That psychiatrist changed and also saved my life. I was so fed up and came into that appointment ready to sit through another useless waste of time but he knew what he was doing and I owe everything to him.

1kp9xy6,msw9jmh,FrequentDress8497,2025-05-18 02:51:04,"Yeah, a lot of ppl can relate to that feeling of always wanting to get home to 'relax,' even when you're out doing things or at work. It's like your mind is always one step ahead, planning your escape route back to your comfort zone, and you can't really be present. That ""mental laziness"" you describe, especially with the fear of failure and then feeling angry at yourself... that's a tough cycle.

This constant urge to retreat and the difficulty engaging in things that might feel more rewarding long-term, even when you know you ""should,"" could be tied to a few things. Sometimes it's related to anxiety... that underlying hum of needing to be in a predictable, controlled space. Or it could be lingering depressive symptoms, like anhedonia (trouble feeling pleasure or motivation) even if your antidepressant helped with other stuff. The fact that you feel paralyzed by fear of failure is a big clue too, and that often links up with procrastination. It can really drain your mental energy.

It's good you're recognizing this pattern and that it's bothering you. Since you're already on meds, this is def something to bring up with your doctor. They might have ideas about what's going on or if your treatment plan needs a tweak. Sometimes what feels like ""laziness"" is really your brain trying to cope with feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or stuck in a procrastination loop. I wrote a bit about procrastination, particularly how it can show up with ADHD, but the themes might resonate:[https://www.acespsychiatry.com/2024/06/21/understanding-adhd-and-procrastination/](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.acespsychiatry.com/2024/06/21/understanding-adhd-and-procrastination/)",1,0.2222

I’ve been the same way pretty much most of my life (I’m 31) but it becomes more intense when I go through a bad mental health patch. I got PTSD after a traumatic birth 2.5 years ago and that really ramped up the fear and anxiety surrounding not only my own death but now I worry for my daughter too. So much so that I’ve been unable to eat properly for the past 2 years for fear of choking which has had a huge impact on my weight and health.

What is not healthy, is living in a situation that makes you feel that this is wrong or bad. Please take some time and sit with these thoughts and see where they are coming from.

1kp8tri,msxg4sg,MarieKat_02,2025-05-18 09:25:33,"When I was about 6yo I was changing to get ready for school in my living room. I was a child. Not sure why but my mother came in and said “have you no modesty?!” … I was 6 maybe 7. I didn’t even know being naked was bad yet probably. I’m also sure she’s the one who laid my clothes out in the living room in the first place. Not to mention she would put me in the bath with my brother 4 years older and shower with my dad. Why would I need modesty all of a sudden? Anyways I felt ashamed to be naked or show any skin my entire life until maybe the past 4 years. I’m now 34. I grew up on the beach and wore jeans to the damn beach until I was ready to jump in the water. I’d get out and immediately wrap myself in a towel. While other females walked around in a bikini, I was covered in a towel or jeans at the beach all bc my shame stemmed from my mother embarrassing me and confusing me at such a young age. She did things like that often. I didn’t even tell her when I got my period for almost a year bc I was actually scared she would tell our whole family. My mother has no shame and doesn’t understand boundaries which in turn caused me to have an over abundance of boundaries and have always been ashamed of my pale skin and showing even an acceptable amount of skin despite having a beautiful body. I spent my whole life while I had a great body being ashamed of it and now two c sections later and I regret feeling that way. 

I say all this to explain your shame stems from somewhere way deeper bc masturbation is a natural human urge. Now who’s to really say what’s excessive either? Everyone is different and has a different sex drive. DO NOT WASTE YOUR LIFE feeling ashamed over something that is the most natural human urge we have. If you feel that terrible I suggest maybe going to therapy if you’re comfortable enough to do so to break through that shame. Someone made you feel that way as a child I’m sure and it has carried over into your teenage or adult hood. You’re going to be okay dude!",3,-0.9917

1. Are you really smart? Many many times the most gifted students become the most lazy students because they never have to really work hard at anything. Are you not winning awards because you’re not good enough for them, or are you not winning because you’re not putting yourself in the running? I could be a successful author if I ever finished a book… but I never have. That’s on me.

2. You’re probably not lazy, you may just have your priorities in a non productive place. Virtually nobody I went to high school with that was doing impressive things then, is doing impressive things now. Winning national awards and all that CAN lead to success, but it often doesn’t and those kids often end up doing the same jobs at the same pay as their average counterparts. Should you be basing your value as a person on awards, or is there a more honest way to assess your value?

3. Average people run the world. Even if you actually are average (and I suspect you’re not) that doesn’t preclude you from an above average life. The more people you meet the more you’ll realize how many successful, famous, respected, wealthy people are actually pretty dumb.

4. You sound very young. It’s never too late to change. The question to consider is whether the change you need to make is with your actions or with your perspective.",1,0.9835

You may just need more perspectives. You may be short of concepts. You may have too many concepts! You may be lost in concept! Or at least lost in how to conceptualise this particular set of faulty beliefs about the world, probably yourself and, of course, Santa Clause. I'm joking about that last one. 

You're entitled to pussy, right? 
It's your man-given right! bestowed upon you by generations of expert female oppressors. 
Conditioned into you that timeless belief that male is superior to female. 
A slap here and a slap there, keep er in line, just shut up, and everything will be fine. 

That was our mum, my entire childhood. 
My dad was a toxic bully, but only to women and children. Never grown men! 
So, a coward no less! 

He gaslit the shit out my mum, blackmailed and coerced her. Listened in on her phone calls, read her letters...oh that reminds me, one night he came in and found a ripped up handwritten letter in the bin; my mum was at the bar with her friend, so I sat and watched my dad laying out and arranging all the pieces on the table, putting them all back together with a mild sneer on his face. 
Our caravan trips, I remember, too. He'd lock her in the caravan whilst he took us to the fair, leaving her with no phone and no money. 
Why? Control! 

He'd lecture her for hours, tell her how wrong she was, that she was stupid and fat. 
Sometimes, she wasn't allowed to go out with her friends, or only certain friends approved by him. 

She'd watch for him driving home from work, anxiously glancing out the window. When headlights illuminated the wall, we'd see her tense and panic, rounding us up the stairs to our bedroom where she'd sit with us as he stomped about below; tired and angry from work he'd shout things like ""I know someone has moved xyz"" or ""oh somebody's going to get it"" 

I'm convinced half the time he just made up on the spot our supposed violations of the million and one unspoken rules of the patriarchal household. 

Do you really want to be like this?
This is the extreme end! Granted. Really, though? You want to continue on the redpill path??? My dad would these days be considered extreme red pill. 

He broke my fucking mum dude! He broke my fucking mum!
I just started crying real tears as I wrote that. Like actually I'm crying man! And that's ok and you know why?? 
Because vulnerability is BEAUTIFUL!!!!
Yeah all caps! That beautiful! 

I will NEVER EVER be like my dad! 
I will be forever vulnerable! 
I will NEVER EVER be like my dad 
I implore you to not be like him either!

Then they become evil, cruel, rude. They start tearing down that woman’s confidence. Making her feel like no one else will care about her except for him, because she’s been mentally abused into believing that is true. Once the woman can finally leave the relationship, it goes one of two ways. Either that woman is so broken and her confidence is so shot, that these predatory men can sense that and they get caught in the never ending loop. OR they leave that relationship and take it in stride. They learn the signs to watch out for and will eventually find themselves a good and genuine man.

1kp5xs0,msvlp2x,TisOnlyTemp,2025-05-18 00:08:07,"Not sure what you mean by failed sex? But i will say there's nothing wrong with being a virgin regardless of age. Everyone is different, we all have different lives, upbringings, circumstances etc. Some of us are just unlucky, some of us are dealing with shit and some just don't care.

Everyone will tell you it's nothing special etc. But it's always people who've had that experience. So they tend not to understand how it can play on your mental health to have gone your whole life without what's supposed to be a basic human experience and intimacy. So I know it can suck big time. I will say though that it is something you should try not to care about. The more you obsess the worse it'll get and the desperation for it will just make it less likely.

Focus on things that matter more in the grand scheme of things. Friendships, family, career, education, experiences, travel etc. Live your life and do what's best for you. make good friends, maybe get a pet. Find ways to not feel lonely. Also, don't watch porn of you do already. A little can be healthy now and then. But limit it as much as possible or all together if you can.

Finally, in terms of relationships and sex. My best advice honestly would be friends again. Make friends, expand your social circle. And make platonic female friends (Without any intent or hope of intimacy). Just friendship. It'll honestly help in more ways than you'd think. The more people you know, the more connections you make. The more likely you'll meet somebody naturally and develop something. Best part is if it's developed naturally, there more trust, intimacy and safety. So the pressure will be greatly reduced. Nothing stops you still messing around on dating apps too. But if your mental health is being affected by not having sex. I'd honestly stay clear. Maybe get back into therapy too if you can. Anything to help keep you in a healthy State. But you definitely shouldn't stress over it honestly. Best thing is just accept it is what it is, and it'll happen when it happens. Just live normally, don't overthink things or put pressure on yourself.",1,0.9982

1kp5xs0,msvy2fl,Bojangles_B,2025-05-18 01:31:11,"Don't listen to others in this thread. Sex is important, mainly for men. For mental and physical health. Quit the fapping, or at least reduce it to MAX once a week/fortnight. This increase in stored testosterone will make it naturally easier to be physically and psychologically motivated to go to the gym. Going to the gym will further increase your testosterone leading to you being more willing to emotionally and sexually connect with women and being able to find the right opportunities to do so. More importantly it will help get you out of your own head and make you generally happier and less apprehensive. It will obviously make you more healthy and (even more) physically attractive to women as their pheromones can sense that you're healthy too.

You are still quite young at 24 so don't beat yourself up that you haven't landed anything yet. 

Dating apps seem like scams/hopeless, but it's just a numbers game. The more women you put yourself in the position of talking to online/offline, with both you and the other party both being clear about the desire to date, will simply increase the chances of you getting some hot honey.

If you have avenues to pursue women offline then absolutely go for those but it seems as though the vast majority of people of all ages across the Western world do not, and that is simply an unfortunate societal/technological issue, mainly due to the cesspool that is social media.

Lastly, it takes time to make changes in your life, so try to have patience with the progress of your situation and that will in turn lead to a calmer and more positive outlook and attitude which women will inherently find more attractive. However, you can make an immediate and positive change right now by reducing fapping.

1kp5ltn,mswcd74,GlumOnion447,2025-05-18 03:11:34,"I’m 39, a nurse with a college degree. I can only speak from personal experience and some basic research, but I’ll give my thoughts on this. 

I too struggle with memory. Most of my childhood is a haze. Most of my teens, even my 20s and 30s. I remember feelings most, moments of embarrassment or sadness, anger, but I don’t remember 99 percent of my own life.

From my own research and therapy, I’ve concluded that there are multiple reasons for this. First, anxiety and depression can severely affect the memory. Things like trauma, whether emotional, sexual, or physical, can cause disassociation where a person leaves their own body mentally in order to protect themselves. It’s not uncommon for people with trauma in their past to not remember much of their life growing up. Drugs and alcohol also play a roll, and will decrease memory. Disorders like ahhd also effect memory. I dealt with emotional neglect growing up and I believe it’s a large part of why I can’t remember a lot.

Then there is a genetic component, my parents don’t have great memories either, not to the extent of mine though. 

Lastly, studies show that much of what we “remember “ is false. So, that day at the pool with your friends when you were 13 may have been something you thought of so many times it became real in your mind. Eye witness testimony often convicts the wrong person in criminal trials. Many people could simply have vivid imaginations and feel like they remember much more than they do.

Of course there could be other reasons such as lead poisoning, and other environmental factors. 

I’ve made a pretty good life for myself. I try to live in the moment, I work on my mental heath, and I’ve researched ways to improve memory through exercise, diet, medication, and therapy.  I’m still searching for answers. I’ve found that treating my adhd and anxiety has really helped. Living in the moment has really helped, it gives experiences more meaning which makes things more memorable. Eventually I may see a neurologist or some specialist to look closer at my memory problems , but I’m content and thriving for now. Don’t get down, life is hard but things will get better. Human beings are amazing at adapting.",1,-0.7747

My first one said I was fine at my second one I had three pain drs two that quit one after the other in the middle of treatment plans then one who just dismissed my issues so I went to another clinic. It’s been a long journey but at least I know what’s wrong.,1,-0.9924
1kply4j,mszl2lz,Old-Goat,2025-05-18 17:46:43,"There are always many facets of pain to consider. Pain relievers will help to relieve the pain, but they may not do a damn thing for the underlying problem. They are both valid concerns, but very different things. Pills and potions are a convenience, but in most cases, they dont repair. You usually need something more for that. It can get really complicated if there are multiple causes, with each creating its individual version of hell, at a different location in your body. 

I dont mean to critique anyones post, but while it was helpful to see a list of what you have tried, the outcomes would have been helpful too. Maybe a little more specificity would be helpful too, but you were right not to list a boatload of drugs, Reddit often flags that sort of thing. 

When you say the patches helped, I assume you mean lidocaine? If it helped, even just a litttle, where did you position the patch? If it helped, you had to be at least close, to the correct spot. Its a place for your doc to consider intervention, if its possible... 

Im not sure how to say this and make the degree of sarcasm live up to the comment, but you should let your doctors know they no longer have to guess at whats wrong with a patients spine, they have this stuff called medical testing. Xrays, CT scans, MRI's, and ultrasound.  There are even some basic neurological exams they can do with the little knee hammer and that spikey wheel they run along the bottom of your feet, etc. Sometimes the results can be quite telling. Medical tests, what a concept!

How did I do? Did that seem sarcastic enough? They got LOTS of tests. Did they do any? 

The results of any medical test are really something you should review for yourself. Find out what it all means, even if its just a bunch of interesting stuff thats not really germane to the pain. Most medical testing isnt done to look for a problem, they are done to rule out possibilities. It may seem like the long way around, but they do it so nothing (hopefully) gets missed. 

I hate to revisit the drugs, but the results from a specific type of pain medication can sometimes indicate the cause of pain. If you have inflammation and an anti inflammatory drug helped, its peanut butter and jelly. They go together well...

4 months, is long enough to call this, whatever it may be, chronic. Its usually as you cross the 90 day ""anniversary"". But the thing that really separates chronic pain from acute pain, is the psychological part. There is not a lot in life than can equal constant pain for causing depression. And nothing creates anxiety like not knowing why your body is doing this to you. Its not abnormal to feel these things. Its justified. It still needs treatment, but its justified. You should get some counseling, from someone who is familiar with the psychology of pain. Someone not specializing in pain can be worse than no counseling, so be picky. This aint PTSD, unless the ""P"" stands for ""present"". They cant treat this like other traumas, A: youre being traumatized WHILE youre getting therapy, and B: you cant leave and go to a shelter to get away from this tormentor...those arent the only ways chronic pain patients are a special population, just a couple examples why providers need to specialize in pain. Your best bet to find somebody would be through a pain specialist, some have a psychologist or social worker on staff, a psychiatrist might be overkill, since any MD should be able to Rx any meds that might be considered helpful for depression/anxiety. 

This is hard to put in to words, but the counseling wont directly help your actual pain. Its mostly for the psychological symptoms of chronic pain, several of which you mentioned. Anger and guilt are pretty common too. While counseling wont directly reduce or eliminate your pain, what it can do is *change the way you react to pain.* It also sounds like you want to improve your relaxation skills. There's an art to squeezing the most out of what relaxation opportunities you do get. Hang in there, and make them do some tests....",1,-0.9956

Two: before you go, keep a journal of what's been happening, ie Thursday 24th May Mum struggled to walk, due to pain in left knee. That sort of thing. Also list her symptoms, and jot down all the questions you want answers to, just so you can be sure you cover everything while you're in there, and don't forget anything. Obviously put her journal of symptoms on a separate page/s, so you can give it to the doctor to peruse, so he has a clear idea of what he may be looking at.


These are things that may aid you a bit. Outside idea, is it possible your mother has sleep apnaea? That would explain the feeling like she's suffocating. I don't know though, it just came to mind.

Arthritis is actually an immune system problem but anti inflammatories may be helpful for pain. I dont see a rheumatologist on the list? Just seeing a single specialist sometimes isnt enough. Not all doctors are good at what they do. The best way to sort it out should be multiple opinions. There's a few things that can mess with the body's ""thermostat"", one of the usual suspects is often the thyroid. A bit of bloodwork should tell the tale. Another common issue is also medication side effects. That would be worth checking, theres lots of on line interaction checkers.

Im not too sure about the wisdom of waiting a month to see a doctor, or seeing an orthopedic for a breathing problem. Oxygen levels are a big deal, since oxygen calms you down. Low oxygen levels can often mean high adrenaline levels. Not helpful for trying to sleep or relax.

I saw above that your mom doesn't eat much but is still obese. Have you looked into a gastronomy (stomach) specialist? If your mother is having stomach problems it can cause many issues due to lack of nutrients, which also makes you crave junk food. Maybe try a nutritional meal replacement shake? Or look into FODMAP (an acronym for the different digestive enzymes that people can be sensitive to) and see if changing what she eats helps. When I eat something I'm sensitive too I can swell up to 15lbs. Monash university is the leading resource and research center for FODMAP.


For the next 1 - 3 months track everything, mood, food, pain either in a written journal or app (Dailio is fantastic). Then bring the journal to all your appointments to give a fact based history you don't need to worry about remembering (working memory likes to go on vacation when you're stressed).


If available in your area book a new general practice family dr after you've collected some data, give them no diagnosis' (within reason, some are pretty fact diagnosed and the testing is expensive for some of them) and see what they suggest and what test they may offer that are different or more extensive then you're mothers had before.


See if your mother is willing to try and wear her CPAP mask (doesn't need to be hooked to anything just on her face) around when she is watching TV/distracted in some way so she can get use to the feeling awake and it isn't so hard at night.

This is the actual [MPQ](https://www.sralab.org/sites/default/files/2017-07/McGill%20Pain%20Questionnaire%20%281%29.pdf). I studied pain scales and survey methodologies as part of my grad work, and the MPQ was one that I really dug into.

The point of the McGill pain index was to use *patient language* to create a pain scale, not the numbers or faces scales. The researchers interviewed MANY pain patients and used the words they found consistently appeared in interviews to create different “categories” of pain for patients to use. This graphic feels misleading because it’s just showing numbers and conditions without the category breakdown.

For example because the MPQ measures pain along multiple axes, there’s different forms of the MPQ that have more and fewer categories. This one implies it’s the OG scale from 1975, but that doesn’t make sense because they’ve tweaked the categories and size in the past 50 years. The categories include:

- affective: how does your pain make you feel emotionally
- temporal: how long has this been happening
- intensity: how intense (traditional kinda 1-10 scale)
- quality: burning tingling crushing?

I really wish this image would stop doing the rounds on here because it feels so incredibly inaccurate and misleading. The MPQ has benefits and drawbacks, but one of its benefits is that it’s been shown over and over to be an accurate way of measuring patient reported chronic pain. We can’t complain about how inadequate the rate your pain on 1-10 scale is and then reject a cherry-picked, misleading representation of one of the gold standard pain scales for chronic pain .

In between are things like need to lie down, cannot think of anything but the pain, unable to speak due to severity of pain, etc. 

It cannot be overstated how different any level of chronic pain is from severe, short lived extreme pain. The effect of not being able to escape the pain is extreme and charts like this fail to recognize this fact.

Sorry OP this does not answer your question. I get both migraines and sinus headaches but anymore I am not sure there is a whole lot of difference between them and I will tell you why. Migraine headaches have a big blood vessel component. The blood vessels swell and shrink causing the headache. The swollen sinuses probably have similar swelling though a sinus headache will be on both sides of the head with pressure on all the places sinuses are. Migraines tend to only be on one side of the head and have ride along symptoms that sinus headaches don’t like nausea, photo and photophobia (light and noise issues), and all the symptoms that come with aura ( visual disturbances, etc).",1,-0.9863

Do you have seasonal allergies? Hear me out. A few years ago.i was having the worst flare up of my arthritis in my feet and my knee. I tried so many things; really expensive shoes (to be fair they are very comfortable and a brand known for being very supportive), various meds, CBD, physical therapy. I even had an MRI just to make sure it wasn't something worse than arthritis. Then one day costco was out of the allergy med I took. So I got a different one. Within a couple of days the pain went from barely being able to stand for 5 minutes to it only bothering me a bit if I was on my feet for a long time.

It's not that your doctors are lying to you, they just don't know what is possible via conservative treatment... They know some options but not all...

For me, this type of curve (and tilt in the head if you take another look) came from sitting at a desk with a broken chair (long story...). My muscles eventually locked my bones into this shape.

My point isn't to push MY way onto you, but I would be surprised if your doctors knew about either of these approaches. I would do as much research as I could before opting for surgery...

I have a brother too but he is horrible. So many arrests for violence against women and he is the favorite and has done everything to me from killing my pets to threatening SA. All his ex's have restraining orders against him and even with the proof my mom will side with him she has such cognitive dissonance with him, I haven't seen him in 22 years or her in over 10 and its not because I don't want to its because it's not safe. Even she has had to call the police on him. In 2002 when our bio dad died we had to go South to the US for my dad's estate and my brother couldn't come with, and my mom said he'd lost his passport- in 2002 you still didn't need a passport to go from Canada to the US and so that was a lie and then at customs they held me and interrogated me for 45 minutes about him. All I could say was ""yes that's my brother"", ""no I don't know what he did"", ""I know he's a bad guy and I try to avoid him"" and ""I'm glad he can't come"" over and over.

That being said (disclaimer: this is purely anecdotal and not actual evidence of the innate goodness or badness of kratom), I had used it awhile back when my insurance wouldn’t cover my script. It was out of desperation and pain. Kratom isn’t as effective as regular opioids but did help me somewhat with the physical withdrawal symptoms and the pain. I have nerve pain related to DDD and several herniated discs, along with arthritis, endplate degeneration, SI joint dysfunction, weakness, and numbness/tingling in my left leg. For me it only slightly helped, but I have been on a moderate dose of opioids for several years (30mg morphine ER 2x daily and 5/325mg Percocet up to 2x daily) which I’m sure had something to do with that. 

It did not mess with my head or cognitive abilities (again, I do have a tolerance to opioids so take this with a grain of salt) though Ive been told if you take a higher than normal dose your vision can start to wobble. I kept my dose as low as possible and stopped it as soon as my medications were covered some days later, so I can’t speak to any addiction. 

Hope this helps. I know many people will shoot down the use of kratom out of fear but we are all just trying to make it to tomorrow with manageable pain levels. Be prepared if you end up trying it, some pain management clinics test for it now and it’s not legal everywhere.",5,-0.945

1kp61q4,msvpb4f,xX_VapeNayshYall_Xx,2025-05-18 00:32:07,"I used to take regular kratom. I unfortunately ended up abusing it, and it started to make me very nauseous/puke. This led me to take extracts which did not give me nausea, but were much stronger and basically led to me living in denial for about 3 years where I was physically and mentally addicted to kratom extracts. 

The last 18 months of this addiction I discovered an even stronger kratom extract called 7-Hydroxymitragynine that I switched to. Do not take 7-Hydroxymitragynine pills or powders. Many smoke shops will advertise 7-Hydroxymitagynine as better alternative because it has not taste and is stronger. I knew it was addictive, but I was still floored by how terrible the withdrawals were.(Insomnia, muscle cramps, diarrhea, restless legs, sweating, feelings of impending doom)


Regular Kratom is a tree leaf that primarily contains the alkaloid mitragynine (1-5% by weight) which converts to 7-Hydroxymitragynine in the liver with about 30% efficiency when digested. Regular kratom is harder to abuse due to the large amounts of plant material that must be consumed and the natural pharmacology of mitragynine. 

Pure 7-Hydroxymitragynine pills are made semi synthetically with raw kratom by legal but dubious suppliers with little to no regulation currently. Pure 7-Hydroxymitragynine is as strong as any opioid I have been prescribed in my opinion. It has a 4-6 hour half life and gives a rush of euphoria that would never be possible with regular plain leaf kratom. 7-Hydroxymitragyne acts on opioid, serotonin, adrenal, and dopamine receptors which gives it a unique pharmaceutical profile. The withdrawal was the worst I have personally experienced. It required me to check into rehab and take suboxone for a couple weeks. I am now off all opiates / opioids thank GOD. I wish I never would have started with kratom extracts.

If you do try kratom stick to the natural plant powder only, and stay away from any extract. These  pure semi-synthetic alkaloids are  sinister and will certainly be made illegal in the USA soon. My state of TX is already attempting to make 7-Hydroxymitragynine illegal.",4,0.8851

I don't have 'addiction' so I have no issues with that, but if I don't take kratom at my morning dose, I definitely can tell by the body aches and feverish feeling. 

Don't be fooled, though. Kratom IS AN OPIOID. It is a mild, sometimes legal OTC opioid. It acts on your brain and your body exactly the same as opioids. If you are prone to addiction, it can absolutely cause addiction. It can affect your tolerance for other opioids, and block those receptors to make the other opioids less effective.

You have to experiment with the dosage because it’s different for everyone. If you decide to try it, make sure you talk to someone with knowledge about dosing.

I would think if that were possible, they would be advertising the fact ""now manganese free"" instead of discouraging questions... 

Aside from that, Kratom is an opioid like any other opioid, so you can expect physical dependence. That includes opioid withdrawal, if its stopped suddenly after a long period. Youre supposed to taper down, even if its a pharmaceutical opioid. Physical dependence happens with many drugs, its not an abnormal thing that just happens to drugs of abuse. Its completely normal, even if it sucks terribly, your body is working as should be expected, for stopping a substance after a long period.

Addiction is a behavioral issue thats more dependent on the addicts behavior than any particular drug. It really should fit any addiction if you ever need a litmus test ...lack of control, disregard for consequences, that sort of thing.. 

If the doctors involved in your care are afraid to treat your pain, do you think its wise to let them dictate post op pain management?  Just saying they arent showing an ability to properly manage your pre op pain, or you wouldnt be asking about as weak an analgesic. It aint dilaudid. 

I dont think you'd have a problem with an opioid and anesthesia, thats is its best point that theres very little respiratory depression. Theyre taking you deeper than that, you'll probably be intubated for most of the surgery, anyhow.

Quite honestly, I would re approach your doctor (pick one, only) and tell them in what ways your pain is disrupting your life. It not like they need to carry you on pre-op meds for 17 years, its for a freaking month!   An opioid wont screw up your anesthesia, but I'll tell you what will...if your blood pressure is sky high and uncontrolled, you might be sitting on a tennis ball a longer than a month. Which was going to be my ""break glass in case of emergency"" rescue for sciatica. Seriously, sit on a tennis ball. You want to position it roughly where your back pants pocket sits. You will definitely feel it, when you are on that pressure point. The sciatic nerve is real shallow there. You can vary the amount of weight you want to put on it. Usually you want 10 minutes on, 10 minutes off, less if your foot falls asleep. Im serious, when all else fails against sciatica, the tennis ball can beat it down. Of if you have a friend that you feel comfortable sking them to lean in to that spot with their elbow, that works pretty well, too. I had an old chiropractor show me the tennis ball thing.

I relate very much to your post. It's hard. You suffer in silence. No one feels what you're feeling, so they just assume you're okay. You're not in the foetal position so you must be fine right? 

For me, I really struggle with not just communicating the level of debilitating pain, but also that I have to say it. Further to this, it's the having to repeat it. It's a case of you saying it once and that should be enough. But it always needs of be repeated. Becuase the specific words got used, meant something else. No matter how clear and concise you were. 

I'm currently on insurance and my case manager, and return to work specialist needs to be told that I'm constantly in pain, every time I talk to them.
It's like the every time I tell them, is the first time they've heard it. That's traumatic in itself.

Installing it is quick (20 mins) and, with the exception of a couple of pricks, it’s pain free. Dealing with the wires and device/battery…especially for thoracic area of the spine, can be a little tricky. You’ll need to be strategic about where they install the wires (i suggest long enough to where you can snap it on yourself….i.e., bring the battery and wires lower down your back and to the side. That way you’re not dependent on someone else. Because wires are magnetic, you can connect it yourself. But it’s an awkward place to reach.

You will need someone to help change the dressings. It says change them weekly, but I would recommend not changing them the first week. It took me two weeks to work things out for myself (to your point, there isn’t a lot of info out there).

The company is really good with support. You’ll have direct contact with Sprint and they’ll look after you. Flying/TSA is fine, but no MRI. So if you have periodic scans upcoming, get them done prior to installation.

They will test the signal strength during installation. I recommend not speaking up too quickly. The first jolt will be awkward, but you kind of want to hold out. That gives you more room to play with, when you turn on the device. For example, for the first installation, I signals pretty quickly that it was working well. That meant I turned the wireless remote to 85-99 to get relief. For the second installation, I learned from the first and was more patient. That meant I only needed to get to 40-50 to get relief.",2,0.9918

Me too . Opioids are the only reason I’m alive as well. I have intractable pain (8 yrs) and it would’ve killed me if my pain hadn’t been managed at all.

Drowsiness is a side effect of opioid analgesics. It should ""evaporate"" given enough time. Being on a feeding tube may be an additional challenge for you and your docs, since the main side effect, one that you will absolutely have to address, is chronic constipation. If you notice this, tell your doc, it can be managed, but its another med to add to the collection.

They really do oversell the ability of any pill to relieve pain. All this opioid fuss is really overblown. They have pumped so much bullshit about these drug in to the court of public opinion, its hard to know what the truth is and what is pure crap.

There may be a nationwide shortage of opioid analgesics, but they will never run out of paranoid bullshit about opioids.

My only advice would be to try to take them for as short a periods as possible. Try to avoid them for longer term daily use. It’s easy to develop tolerance to them. That leads to needing escalating doses that would be considered dangerous to opioid naive patients. So either access or tolerance will become a problem eventually. It can’t be the main long term plan. 

Make sure they are integrating other methods too like paracetamol or better NSAIDS that can help reduce inflammation too. Make sure there are DMARDS reducing joint damage too. PT is our version of going to the gym for safe exercise. Neurologists can be good at addressing pain too. 

Access to daily doses of opioids for pain is very unique to the USA though. I moved to Scandinavia and they almost laughed when I asked for a bottle of Norco. I have more artificial joints than Lindsay Wagner in Bionic Woman and it’s just nota thing we can get. It’s both bad and good. We overmedicate and that causes its own problems in the USA. 10 years ago I was on Duragesic patches after spine surgery. I look at the Trinity combo- opioid, muscle relaxant, anxiety. I consider it a miracle I woke up breathing every morning.

Today I qualify as opioid naive. In practice my pain levels are similar or less now. Some of it is way less stress - I wont lie. I am happier this way though with my 14 pack of oxy 5’s that I can get once every 3 months unless it’s something acute and major. I honestly feel healthier acknowledging some of my pain and not getting blunted by the poly-pharmacy side effects. 

It can take a long time to come to terms with chronic illness, so be kind to yourself. Do not assume it will only get worse either because that’s rarely true. Lots of us experience both flares but also remission periods. So don’t get discouraged. But also continue to evaluate your pain management treatment if it includes opioids because even they have ceiling, and then it catches up with you.

I know when HMO's  (health management organizations) first came on the scene, it was like a club, if you accepted the insurance, you got a monthly fee for each patient you carried, whether you saw them that month or not.

Some of my coworkers had EDS, and I had posted on reddit about some chronic pain I was experiencing and a shit ton of people went ""not to scare you, but that sounds like eds"" and my boss goes ""not to scare you, but that sounds like eds""

so I go to my PCP (a different one from when I was a kid) and explain the hypermobility, my immune system problems, balance problems, etc and admit I think it could be EDS. She agrees but wants to rule out autoimmune disorders. Doesn't even make me do the Brighton scale because I'm in severe pain, just full on believes me when I explain.

 She sends me to a rheumatologist, who tests me for about 60 different autoimmune disorders, and then sort of goes ""yeah I guess if you REALLY want to get diagnosed we can send a referral to a geneticist four hours away BUT it's a year long wait list AND there's no fix for it"" like she's dissuading me????

Like yes ma'am after ten years I would like a diagnosis? Please? Then my opthalmologist goes ""yeah you could have EDS"" because my Sclera are blue (which reddit helpfully pointed out to me LAST YEAR on a separate account)

In the meantime they're sending me to physical therapy for the hypermobility in the hopes it helps more than the past few rounds.

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Then my nerve specialist and rheumatologist got together to do some tests n they told me I also had fibromyalgia.  I had no idea what it was so he described it by saying, the part of my brain that deals with pain doesn't know how to shut off. It's continually receiving pain signals, especially from my legs etc, but also when I hurt myself, my brain thinks that pain is still there after some time, were someone without the condition would be pain-free after that same amount of time. He also said its common in ppl who have had long term chronic pain.
He explained that the condition can be very painful and along with my other conditions, I should always be under a chronic pain clinic so it doesnt get out of control. App fibromyalgia can be gotten under control if there is no underlying injury or painful condition.

\- Appointment every 28 days/4 weeks on the dot.  
\- Rx is for 28 day supply, not 30.  
\- Pills counted & charted at every visit.  
\- Rx for anything stronger than Hydrocodone is sent to a Home Delivery pharmacy that brings your Rx to your door, on your due date, thus preventing early refills, even by 1 day.  My refill day is Saturday, and I have to be home from 9am-5pm that day.  Not home when they show up?  NO meds till they schedule another delivery.  
\- In-Office rapid drug screen at every visit, with that sample also being sent to outside lab for confirmatory testing, therefore no patient can claim ""false positive, I didn't drink, I didn't do this, or that""

All of this can be a major PITA, BUT, there IS an upside to this... due to them being this strict, they tend to Rx a bit more liberally.  They have a very high ""first visit turnover"" because once the ones who are actually drug seekers see this, in addition to the fact that nobody gets a Rx on the first visit until previous records, and lab results are back, those folks show up for first visit and never return, thus leaving more time for the REAL pain patients to get proper care and appropriate doses for their pain, instead of them being written off, dismissed, or UNDER treated.",0,-0.6987

1kosbi1,msseu7p,Bivagial,2025-05-17 13:16:13,"All mobility aids will cause pain somewhere to start with. You'll be using muscles in ways they're not used to. 

I can recommend something that helps me with pain relief. It's short acting, but for me it was amazing. Take a long, warm, bath. Add in Epsom salts or a bath bomb if you have one. 

If that helps, ask your doctor about anti-inflamatory meds. Probably won't help any nerve pain, but will help relax muscles, which is likely adding to your pain. 

Be careful with anti-inflamatory meds, even if you get them over the counter. Make sure you have food in your stomach and don't take too much or double up with different types. They're very nasty on the stomach and you don't want a stomach ulcer on top of everything. 

If you want to keep up a form of exercise - which I highly recommend as you don't want your muscles to deteriorate - try swimming or even just walking in a pool. It's _much_ better if it's a heated pool. If the pool is too cold, it can make the pain worse. 

Exercising in water takes a lot of pressure off your joints and muscles. Just be ready for extreme exhaustion the moment you get out of the pool (I had to be carried to the changing rooms). 

For sleep, have an electric blanket pre-heat your bed. Make sure to turn it off when you go to sleep. The extra warmth may help. 

Make sure you stay hydrated. It's amazing how much of a difference it makes. Remember that soda and caffiene aren't good at hydration and make sure you drink water or electrolyte drinks as well. Preferably water should be your main drink, with anything else as a once or twice a day treat. 

You're very likely underhydrated. Up the amount of water you drink in a day. Have a bottle with you at all times and sip from it often. I sip mine every 10-15 minutes. This is more effective for keeping you hydrated than drinking larger quantities less often. 

If it's legal and available where you live, look into medical cannabis. For some people (myself included), it's a godsend. For others, it does nothing or makes things worse. 

If you take _anything_, legal or not, prescribed or not, OTC, or anything else, make sure your doctor knows about it. They don't care about legalities (in most countries, can't speak for all), just making sure that nothing interacts or causes more problems. 

I even tell my doctor what kind of tea I drink, as some of those can interact with meds. 

I also recommend that if you primarily shower to get clean, get a shower stool. If you can't afford or source a proper one, then a plastic outdoor chair will work in a pinch. Being able to sit for your shower will help preserve energy and might reduce your pain. 

I also recommend looking into gentle yoga exercises to keep your muscles moving. The human body really doesn't like to stay still all the time. Even just 20min of stretching a day can help. Some of them can be done while in bed if you're having a bad pain day. It isn't instant relief, but it does actually help. It can also prevent some kinds of pain that you don't want to get on top of everything else.",4,0.7409
1kosbi1,mstlhoc,Wibblywobblywalk,2025-05-17 17:15:46,"Try sleeping with a cushion between your knees, i'm hypermobile with a lot of joint pain and this helps. You can get wrist/ankle supports from the pharmacy that help too when you're out. Check your footwear isn't making things worse.. a good walking boot with some ankle support and cushioning.

If you take cocodamol too often it can give you headaches .. try switching it out with aspirin or ibruprofen or having a day off painkillers whenever you're able to chill at home.

Hot bath with epson salts, hot water bottle.

If you can't exercise then stretch gently every day.. ask to see a physiotherapist about gently building muscles to support the painful joints.

Glucosamine and calcium supplements, also vitamin D and E are protective of joints. You could ask to see a nutritionist about a non inflammatory diet.. some types of rheumatoid arthritis respond to that although there is a lot of nonsense on the internet.

Good luck with your diagnosis, keep on at the GP for better pain relief, cocodamol shouldn't be a long term solution.",3,0.9729

The amount of shit that doctors told me about how doomed I was to a certain horrific and depressing life path was overwhelming and heartbreaking. Twenty years on, turns out that most of them didn't know what the fuck they were talking about, had no real idea about patient outcomes, and didn't reckon with the pace of medical advancement to treat what was dealing with. I also dealt with a lot of misdiagnosis and that was a difficult path, but by age 30 I was living a very happy life and the things they had predicted had not come to pass. Doctors are fallible and many of them are fucking ignorant. Take what they say with a grain of salt and don't let them preemptively close off the paths of your dreams, because you never know what might happen, and that includes good things like medical advancements, medication, self-education and self-advocacy, personal and mindset growth, and learning coping skills that work for you.

You go through the 5 steps - denial, depression, anger, bargaining, acceptance - and then go start over again. It's worse at times compared to others, and when you go through periods where your pain isn't getting worse (even if it may not be improving either), the acceptance steps tend to get longer and the other steps don't feel quite as strong. 

A major factor in dealing with the worst parts for me has been finding a community of people who also understand what it's like to be in chronic pain. No matter how well-meaning people without chronic pain are, they just don't understand it, and there are things it can be hard to talk about with them.

I spent years on medications that still left me in pain. 2 months ago we decided to do a radical change of my treatments. It worked. I now live a comfortable life, for the most part, only needing a codeine tablet some nights, and one pill 3 times a day (I do take others, but they're not for the fibro) to help control it. I am, for the most part, under control now, with much lower pain levels, enough to make life bearable again, and make me think I have a chance at rejoining society once more.

I did therapy to adjust as I was grieving hard. I couldn’t accept my new normal. This isn’t my only chronic pain problem I have other diagnosis but this was the one that changed my life. Treatment helps now. I still get random symptoms such as pain but it’s not as constant. It’s been almost 20 years with this condition.,1,-0.9423
1kopll1,msthb04,BriefKaleidoscope220,2025-05-17 16:53:26,Coming to terms with it is the best thing. You didn't share your condition. But I asked my doctor for about a year if it was only going to get worse. Then one day I broke down. He said yes. I made peace with jt.,1,0.6067
1kopll1,mstp0vy,Embryw,2025-05-17 17:34:19,"I don't know what your condition is, but for what it's worth, I went through my 20s in terrible, unchecked pain. It took everything from me. But by my early 30s, I was finally able to get treatment, and my life significantly improved. Everything I'd lost to pain, I got back. 

Do I still have pain in my life? Yes. Almost daily. But is it enough to impact my daily life? Only rarely. Most of the time it's easy to ignore. Things that might make someone else cry out to, I often don't flinch. And it's ok, it really truly is. 

Just because pain will be with you your entire life doesn't mean it will _dominate_ your entire life, and there is a very very big distinction between the two.

Obviously everyone experiences pain differently, and your condition might be worlds different than mine, but I just want you to know that it is possible to live a happy and full life even with pain. 

Definitely pursue all pain management options at your disposal, any treatment methods you can get. The thing that made my pain unbearable was that I couldn't get treatment for a decade (thanks American ""healthcare""). So exhaust all medical options, by all means. 

I also suggest looking into therapy, especially someone who deals with grief and chronic conditions. The diagnosis and all that comes with it is surely a lot to weigh on your mind, and it's very helpful to have a professional untangle these things with you.

Best of luck to you friend.",1,-0.7827

1kop52b,mstkm0r,groovy_evil_wizard,2025-05-17 17:11:06,"Ah I had a really similar thing happen to me where all of a sudden my back just started hurting and just didn’t stop. It can be really frustrating. I would take your physio’s advice over chat GPT since they’re a trained professional vs chat GPT just says things that could be sentences. I wouldn’t stop using chat entirely since it’s been helpful for you, however I would try and find an outside source confirming anything chat says before you try it.

With the stretching and the foam roller, I would definetly try that since tight muscles are going to make things worse long term. With everything you try (even stretching), start small and slowly build up. What I’ve found is that sometimes exercises increase pain a little bit and that’s ok, but if the pain doesn’t go away soon after I’ve done the exercise/stretch, I’ve done too much. With experience I’ve gotten a lot better at telling how much pain is ok while I’m doing the exercise so I can stop before I do something that will cause longer-lasting pain. And it took awhile to learn how to do that. Pain is tricky, sometimes you don’t feel the full effects of overdoing it until a day or two after (happened to me once going for a walk, could be what happened to you at the gym). 

I think (idk someone with more expertise PLEASE correct me if I’m wrong) that with the nervous system getting more sensitized to pain, that you have to gradually increase activity to teach it that certain sensations are ok and not a cause for alarm. However you have to also treat the underlying condition that initially caused the pain. 

You’ve mentioned physio’s, but have you been to a doctor? You really want to see a doctor if at all possible for something that’s lasted this long. A physio can treat your condition once you have a diagnosis, but you need a doctor to help figure out what you actually have. 

Anyway, for learning how to still have a life while dealing with your pain I highly recommend Manage Your Pain Before it Manages You by Margaret Caudill.

I had an PE teacher that had a bad shoulder injury and he said he goes checking it regularly but he always has dislocations time to time but he's not worried about it since he knows what is happening and knows how to take care of it because he went to a doctor and learned what was with him and what he should do in these situations.

1kohto7,msubvbd,beachbabe77,2025-05-17 19:40:39,"Hello fellow beach/water lovers! Although I looked, I couldn't find anything pertaining to 'body part removals' on Amazon. I did however find dozens of publications on ""help with hip replacement anxiety,"" or, ""what to expect with a hip replacement.""

 Written by a variety of authors.......from actual patients, to surgeons to medical facilities such as the Mayo Clinic, most seemed extremely user-friendly and should go far to help her/you throughout the procedure.... from surgery to complete recovery.

Regardless, ANY type of surgery is scary, a feeling most everyone can identify with.....so let me share my experience, along with a list of ""must have"" supplies to help ensure a smooth recovery. 

First, establish that she's getting an ""anterior"" rather than the older, ""posterior"" replacement. This is a newer and far more superior technique in that it's done through the front, has a much smaller incision, spares a major muscle group, promotes faster healing and (probably) most importantly, greatly reduces the chances of a ""dislocation"" somewhere down the road. Know too that not all surgeons are trained in this technique, and as it's her body, it's important to have autonomy over her surgical protocol.

Post-op pain management is of equal importance, especially given the critical necessity of physical therapy. (indeed, the better the pain control the more PT one can comfortably accomplish) Get this nailed down several weeks prior to surgery, and don't be afraid to dig in your heels if necessary.

As for ""supplies,"" although like me she'll probably receive a basic ""hip kit"" from the hospital, (which included an inexpensive walker, sock puller-uppers, a long handled shoe-horn and a ""pincher"" to pick stuff up off the floor) I tossed most of it and splurged on better stuff from Amazon.

My absolute necessities included a raised toilet seat, (with arms) a sturdy shower chair, ""grab rails"" for balance while bathing (I purchased the suction-cup variety) a long-handled shower brush, a hand-held shower massage, slide-in bed rails, (critical to safely pull yourself up and out of bed) 2-3 additional ""grabby things"" to pick stuff up off the floor, ""step-in"" tennis shoes (like ""Kizik"" brand), slide-in slippers and a week or two down the road, a ""Rollator"" for safety and stability when walking outdoors. In addition, a lot of people like those large ""wedge pillows"" for back support while reading, working on their computer, watching TV, etc. in bed. All of this is available on Amazon and comes in a variety of brands/price points.

The fact she's a swimmer is fantastic, and if she's anything like me, will hit the water as soon as her surgeon gives the ""o.k."" (around 2-3 weeks post-op) It's truly the best exercise for any type of joint replacement and one her doctor will applaud.

Finally, mobility and a return to ""normal."" Truth be told, surgical relief after the agony of bone-on-bone hip pain is incredible from the start. Compared to ""before,"" I'd gladly undergo a dozen hip replacements before enduring that sort of grisly, grinding pain anytime again. Sure, there will be post-op discomfort....but I think she's going to be surprised (especially given proper pain control) by just how tolerable it is as well as how quickly she's going to heal.

I have small fiber neuropathy with autonomic dysfunction (which means i cannot regulate my body temp at all- one minute I'm dripping sweat when my ac is at 65 and I have 2 fans on me, the next I'm wrapped up in 3 quilts with my space heater on full blast.) When the nerve pain flares and I don't want ANYTHING touching my skin (even my sweet cat) then it gets REAL fun. I do best with soft materials like under armour or Nike dri-fit. 


Sfn won't show on a nerve conduction study/ emg. Only definitive test is a skin biopsy. Neuropathy in general is very difficult to treat. Have you had vitamin levels checked or had an autoimmune lab workup? I'm having some symptom relief with a 20:1 CBD/THC combo (high cbd/ low thc.) If you want to go that route look for a strain called ACDC. ",1,0.8634

But in my case it was kind of unavoidable, a necessary evil to cure me of cancer. In your case it was avoidable, which adds a layer of anger and regret and the knowledge that it could have been different.  That must add a whole separate layer of emotional content to the pain.

I am sorry for the loss of health and comfort this has caused you.  So many of the citizens you served and protected have no idea what you and your colleagues sacrificed for our freedom and safety.

However, as someone with chronic joint and spine issues, many of which effect my neck and hips and lower back...

I can say after 20 years of searching, I have never found a perfect pillow, or even the perfect 5 pillows. 

I'm basically a pillow hoarder at this point, because nothing works every day. Nothing works for every position. I hope you'll find a magic combo that works for you, but if you don't... this is an area where better sleep is worth the inconvenience and space issues with having too many pillows.

I have like 20 fucking pillows of various shapes, sizes, materials and levels of firmness. I even keep pillows that are barely pillows anymore, because they are the right level of squishy-nearly-empty-feather pillow or extreme compacted firm foam for very specific kinds of flares and needs. 

Heck, I even keep extra blankets to mold. I have body pillows, wedge pillows, kneel pillows, lumbar rolls, foam, feather, bamboo stuffed. I even have purchased stuffed animals based on how they nestled in my neck and lower back!

If you can't find the perfect pillow. Find the dozen or two dozen pillows for every occasion, every position. Work those combos as needed. 

I've had to accept that I always have to buy a slightly bigger bed, or I don't use the pillows because in that moment of pain in the night - I'm not going across the room to get them.

For migraines, nothing has helped so far, except for one time it was too much to handle after 4 days of a nonstop one and got a migraine cocktail in the ER, that was the most headache free I’ve been for as long as I can remember.

As far as fibromyalgia/possible hEDS and ankylosing spondylitis/enteropathic arthritis goes, I’m still in the beginning stages of diagnosis and waiting on further blood tests and insurance to figure out which medication we will try first, which my rheumatologist said will either be oral Rinvoq (best option), a self injectable medication every 2 weeks, or IV infusions every 6-8 weeks. I have tried meds, steroid injections, PT, acupuncture, massage, etc on multiple areas of my body, but nothing has ever really helped long term. 

I guess my biggest concern is the fact I’ve been living with this pain for so long and its gotten so much worse the past few years, and even though I’m finally getting the help I need, its becoming too much for me to bear any more.

On top of that he rubs it in my face all the time how I basically took a year and a half of his life away from him by having to take care of me. It's like this constant guilt trip.

It is not like I absolutely have to have his sympathy I don't. It's not like it helps or takes the pain away, but it's nice to know that your loved ones give a crap about you and how you feel. He has never once asked me how are you feeling today?.…. ever. You might say well that's because you volunteer it. I haven't volunteered how I feel for at least 3 months now. I got the message loud and clear that he does not want to hear about my pain. I get it, it's a tiresome subject so I do understand in many ways, but it doesn't stop me from wanting someone to share it with.

So, with that said, I really do feel for you and I know it's difficult. I'm sorry I guess it's good that we have forums like these to vent. At any rate, I definitely can understand your feelings.

Best of luck to you!",1,0.961
1ko3o89,msvx6ov,Top-Squirrel6107,2025-05-18 01:25:11,"Wow, you’re dealing with a lot. Totally understandable that nobody gets it and that dark place when getting overwhelmed. While in the Navy my upper and lower jaws were tore up. A TMJ specialist said it was CMJ ( Cranial Mandibular Joint Disorder) for twenty years taking 720mg of morphine and 4 1mg of Clonazepam daily was all I needed. Lately I am doing legal ketamine and it helps. Sadly everything wears off. Then the over reaction to opioids absolutely about destroyed me. The doctors just don’t care to prescribe the medication and obviously it helped. Now I take barely enough meds to get through the day. Doctors are such dumb people who think pain is just the nerves. It’s so much deeper than that and now I have a doctor talking about nerve ablation. It’s like wait a NY minute this is my head we are talking about. The biggest part of the human nervous system network. Just what nerve do they think they can destroy? I know they have no clue what nerve to destroy. It’s like I will wake up and tell everyone I am the unicorn princess and I wan to wear hot pink everyday! Or whatever whoops no more taste, well you can’t smell anything anymore. They did talk about electro shock therapy but now they call it something else. My response is hell no butt head. Done accuputure tried one doctor and I didn’t do much. Then found another and wow she was amazing. Still the pain in the right side of my head is banging. I don’t like to smoke but last night my frontal lobe was banging and this doesn’t happen often (thank goodness) my son gave me some CBD to smoke and it helped it was mild but it was short lived. Still it was nice to make it stop. That dark place where all the hope gets sucked out or into really bothers me. I want to live but I started making a plan. Chiropractor helped and when my neck would get cracked oh my. Yet a couple hours later and what can I say. I took the same dose of opiates and benzodiazepines for 2 decades. Never wanted to take more. I was as fine, sure I was dependent but not an addiction. Took me meds responsibly and the asshats still took them down. Ketamine is intense but it takes you out of the moment for awhile. Doesn’t exactly tickle the right spot like Gods gift the poppy plant. God put it on the planet and it is the best pain reliever ever. None of the synthetic shit scientists have tried works as well and it’s been used by humans since as far back as the Egyptians. Really boils my blood that some people can tell me how much of Gods GIft I am allowed. Not familiar with dry needling so I will look it up. Some asshat doctor tried needle point injections and it was the worst. If some doctor suggests it to you. Just politely tell them to Phuc off! It hurts like hell. A massage is nice but like stated earlier everything wears off. I am so pissed about the opioid over reaction. They should have been checking patients BAC and if you’re stupid enough to die from an OD then you got what you deserved. I am pretty sure most od’s were not accidents, just irresponsible behavior. Then the hypocrisy people can smoke themselves or drink themselves to death and nobody cares. OR and it’s chicken little time. Not sure if ketamine will help, but if you start falling in to that black hole call me 1(828)215-0000. I know ho it feels. Try and remember that when you’re feeling bad don’t yell at the kid. It’s not their fault and I know my kids have caught me off guard and lost their kneecaps (figuratively) sorry your husband doesn’t get it or want too. A good acupuncture doctor can help but honestly for me taking the right amount of morphine and Clonazepam does the trick. I sleep better, feel like a human and if I don’t answer leave a voicemail and I will call. Just promise me that you will call first before you do anything. ‘K. Pain is so much more than just hurting. It’s inscrutable (look the word up) it destroys your body, heart, mind, spirit and spits you out. Maybe ketamine I go on though Mindbloom. Break a leg sweetheart",1,0.9312

1ko2eju,msn9bu9,LJT141620,2025-05-16 16:02:38,"Hi! I have chronic back pain as well and have always enjoyed camping and am not willing to give it up just yet! I have camped once so far since developing pain, but it has worsened some since then.. but I am planning a few nights tent camping with my family next month! I’m nervous, but want my kids to grow up getting the experience and don’t want to give up on it!

I have a zero gravity camping chair that is very helpful for just relaxing and lounging. I definitely use an air mattress! I use a pillow from the brand “Coop” and they actually make travel pillows that are mini size that I have a couple and like to sort of tuck beside me while I sleep. It may be ridiculous, but I might end up taking a wedge pillow to put under my knees.. sleeping on my back with my knees raised seems to cause me the least amount of pain when I wake up. And finally, getting some refillable ice packs you can just fill with ice from your cooler.

I also have items to make car travel easier.. a lumbar support pillow, seat cushion, and I even found a car plug in heating pad on Amazon. (The refillable ice packs work well for this too, because I can just get cups of ice at gas stations and fill the ice packs up.) of course I pack pain creams and Tylenol as well.

It’s definitely a bit of a pain and requires some extra “gear,” but I really enjoy camping and don’t want to miss out on life! Chronic pain takes so much from us already!!",1,0.7843

I’ve spent most of the last 9 yrs laying in my bed while life continues around me.
So many medical appointments that I forget major information as it all blends into one.
Medication that is at its maximum dose yet still doesn’t make my life possible for very long periods off time. The negative impact in my body for handfuls of tablets just to get me up and able to try to function. Some
 days I can and other days I m screwed and stuck rotting . My term not to be misunderstood?
Pissing myself because I can’t get to my toilet, never being able to sleep more than 3 hours.
4 operations in the the last 2 yrs and tge last one being major open spinal cord and nerve dis placement surgery After 6 months of being very unwell and trying so hard to build a life physically and struggling very much and need a mission to motivate me before I die rotting in my bed!!!!
So yer just going camping is a massive big deal as I’ve not done anything remotely interesting or amusing for years .its more the work part of it to see what I’m physically able to do.

Do you trust your friends to believe you? If you don't, maybe you don't have the right friends. 

You say you this ""honestly anywhere"" - so it sounds less like specifically targeted toward people that don't believe you, and more about a generalized anxiety and fear of judgment from anyone and everyone. I'd consider working with a therapist on letting go of this kind of self-consciousness -- the world is not paying attention to us half as much as we think they are. And practicing drawing boundaries and defending yourself is a much better practice in real life than practicing 'performing' pain for fear of judgment you're not even sure is there.",3,0.2688

I wish I knew with my back.  I guess if I HAD to blame it on something,  it was when I slipped on a patch of ice and went up in the air and landed on my tailbone.  But honestly it doesn't feel like that was it. Maybe it was nothing. My dad had a really bad back. The actual pain started in 1982.

It was gradual. Like once a month then one a week,  etc. Then it was constant and I saw my first doctor.  He did a bone scan of all things.

Now I've had 7 surgeries,  2 fusions (one a 360), and I don't know how many other proceedures and treatments.

I haven't really cried from pain in years. I think I'm dried up 😂

Edit: Oh, I just found out from my spine surgeon(who I'm pretty sure I put his kids through college) that I was born with an abnormally narrow spine canal.  That's why my nerves get impinged so easily.  Um, yay me?",1,0.8358

It took me a long time to accept the new situation.

I know exhaustion is inevitable after any activity—drained, aching, but happy versus exhausted, aching, and bitter.

Recently, I've started a new hobby with eco resin. Nothing complicated—just some nice molds, a gypsum-like powder, and water. Weigh, mix, pour, and it's done. For a small piece, it shouldn't take more than ten minutes. But I need at least fifty minutes to make a tiny figure.

Even the smallest tasks—like a fifteen-minute walk—deplete my energy reserves. They usually amplify the pain too, yet somehow, they leave me feeling satisfied.

There's no playbook on how to handle pain, no foolproof tips.

Start with therapy and self-love. Letting go of resenting your ex for being with someone that makes them happy. Letting go of the idea that you can't be happy unless another person enters your life and makes it better for you. 

You say you don't even want to live anymore. How do you expect to love and receive healthy love with another person when you barely can hold onto yourself? How do you expect someone to devote their lives to you when you're not willing to commit to it yourself? Would you want to commit to someone who is only desperate for the idea of romance while not caring about their own life? That's not healthy and it's not romantic.

Build your life, build yourself, build your hobbies, build your interests, build your joys. You can't have a threadbare shack made of matchsticks and be upset people don't want to enter it.

Never experienced it themselves and if one person has a similar injury that’s not hurting as bad as you they automatically think you’re over exaggerating to get more pain meds. Only problem with this theory is everyone is different and everyone’s pain tolerance is different. I had an older pain doctor 10 years ago that had back problems his whole life. I got, morphine, OxyContin, oxycodone. He told me he understood the pain and would give me anything to try except fentanyl naturally. For me the OxyContin worked great and my pain level was very minimal. I was able to keep working and took it for a year with steroid injections every month until I was all better. Now back in October 2024 my injury resurfaced and is much worse than it was previously. I have only been given Hydrocodone. I have lost my job, can’t bathe myself properly, can’t sleep more than 4 hours (once they wear off I’m fully awake and the pain is to great to fall asleep again) can’t be on my feet more than a couple minutes it causes radiating unbearable pain in my back and leg. It’s no longer a shooting pain its constant and my entire leg lights up. When I’m not on my feet I feel like I have ice water running through my leg. The hydrocodone barely takes the edge off but I can’t do anything but lay on a couch with my legs elevated and the pain is still pretty bad. It works well enough to fall asleep if I’m really tired but soon as it slightly wears off I’m awake. I am pretty much just a cripple that can’t do simple tasks. I’m 37 years old and suffering greatly over these fucking doctors. I’m sure there are sadistic doctors but I think most are just selfish and don’t really care about your needs. They are looking out for themselves and don’t want any attention brought on themselves by prescribing opioids . Many are also all about money and not their patients. My Dad is a doctor that retired during Covid and he says the exact same things and that modern doctors are complete garbage. The war on opioids is causing all of this because junkies are more important than people in chronic pain. At the end of the day pain is not going to kill you and that’s how they see it. There are lots of people that are suffering just like you are. I’ve thought about killing myself as well. I was making 3-5K a week and am barely making 2200 a month now.

This is 100% the pharmacy. Take your business, and that of your friends and family to another pharmacy. Its one thing to get screwed because you have no choice, its another thing to pay them to screw you. You have to stay at one pharmacy at a time for controlled substances, not one pharmacy. You can change pharmacies with a phone call to your doc. 

DEA allows one electronic transfer of a controlled substance Rx between pharmacies. If they refuse, they are not compliant with the law. Call your state Board of Pharmacy. So the ""regular pharmacy should be able to transfer your Rx to the compounding pharmacy, if thats more convenient. I wouldnt expect any sort of cooperation from this pharmacist in getting that done.

Refills have always been based on the pick up date, because many doctors will even specify a ""dont fill before"" date on an Rx. So it doesnt go by the date the Rx was written. But it shouldnt really matter since most insurances give 6 days to pick up an Rx early. 

This may not be your regular pharmacist. You may have had an asshole sitting in for the regular Rph. So its kind of hard to answer if its worth making multiple trips. Call your insurance...find out if there is some reason for this delay, other than a rogue pharmacist. 

If you need a Prior Authorization from the doctor, the insurance would know. It might be worth a stop at the docs office, if thats the case, but they  will likely have to fax it from the office, I dont know if they'd accept a PA faxed from home, any more than an Rx faxed from home. But you can light a little fire under them. You'll still probably have to call the regular pharmacy (where the moron works) as theyre not going to try the Rx to see if it goes through without a reason.to try. 1.5 hrs should be enough time to count out 90 pills. (just a random guess, if I got the # right, it was just luck). I dont know how secure I'd feel that 1.5hrs is long enough. Maybe the regular pharmacist is back from vacation.

A ""revision surgery every 5 years or so, it makes a difference whether youre 18 or 80.

You seem really disappointed that your doc is not considering an implant atm. Im going to suggest doing a search for ""intrathecal medication pump"" and ""granulomas"". You should feel better about the decision to put this on the back burner for now...

Im sorta gruff when I write sometimes, I dont want you taking this the wrong way, but youre working at cross purposes if you step back and look at the big picture. You want better pain control. Who doesnt? But you also want to cut back the analgesics that control your pain. Why? Because some talking empty headed morons on TV told you opioid = bad? Or somebody with a $150 a day heroin habit told you these medications will ruin your life? Side effects being overwhelming

You know its kinda funny, but not humorous, just how much misinformation about opioid analgesics there is. Look at the numbers, dont listen to the rhetoric. You will find out that all this fuss is over 0.40% of the population that develops addictive behavior from Rx opioids.

As far as MME goes, [I'll just give you a link to the  current AMA policy.](https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/policyfinder/detail/CDC%20guideline?uri=%2FAMADoc%2Fdirectives.xml-D-120.932.xml). Read what actual doctors think about MME. And dose limits. The CDC suggested a 90MME limit in 2016, then lowered it to 50MME in 2022, while in the same breath telling doctors that dose limits are not written in stone. [The DEA had/has a limit of 240MME.](https://www.regulations.gov/document/DEA-2024-0120-0001). Its right after the list of states, about 1/4 of the way in to the regulation. Tell me morons arent running this show....

I really dont know what to tell you that wont turn this comment in to a novel, but in a nutshell, the public has been hoodwinked, bamboozled, led astray, and run amok, in regards to Rx opioid abuse. All addictions, from drugs to sex to gambling, etc, affects 4% of the world population. Drugs is a slice of that 4%. Opioid drugs are a slice of a slice of 4%. Rx opioids are a slice of a slice of a slice of 4%. I dont know about anyone else, but I got real curious about the rhetoric vs the numbers. The public doesnt care about facts, they want rhetoric that makes their naughty bits tingle. Sex and drug sensationalism sells. And you wont get elected to any political office telling people Rx addiction is near non existent. All drugs have become street drugs. Its deliberate obfuscation, as the those who are supposed to ""control"" street drugs cant do a damn thing about them, so they seem to have abandoned street drugs. But they can sure screw up pharmaceuticals. In case anyone is unaware, illicit fentanyl has been in street drugs since the early 80's when it was called China White. The problem isnt new, only the demographics have changed, it just moved in to suburbia. The DEA didnt restrict China White imports until 2019. Bedore that you could buy a 55 gallon drum of the stuff, by writing ""not for human use"" on the import form.They let this go on for 40 years, the last 20 of which they were manufacturing a problem that didnt exist to take attention from the real problem they are completely impotent against and they know it. They have to show something for the $4 billion a year, plus all the property they can seize. 

I dont ever expect DEA to hold a press conference to announce they have solved the Rx opioid problem, but if they ever do, people should remember they created it. Its a damn shame our species is so easily led astray and has such little curiosity about how we got in this situation.

Sorry OP, I didnt mean to hijack your post with a sermon. But everyone except the CDC seems to think MME limits are idiocy. There is a hook here too, as a lot of anti opioid zealots managed to navigate themselves in to the CDC, without including little details, like ownership stakes in the largest US drug rehab chain. Big money time. They put 2 million in to lobbying and political influence (take a look at the law firms involved in opioid litigation. Then find out what Senators used to be partners in the firm) and they made $250Billion from congress. A quarter Trillion bucks to increase access to addiction treatment. Enlarge the pool and put in another tennis court. West Virginia, supposedly ground zero for the Rx opioid problem (because they had a pharmacist that dispensed 3 million pills in a town of 500 people). They still do not have a methadone clinic in the entire state.

I'd bet your doc knows something about this. Theyre certainly not afraid of MME limits. As long as the side effects of the pills dont become unmanageable (and I am specifically thinking about chronic constipation), the dose shouldnt be a concern. Someplace between 50MME and 240MME seems to be fine with regulators, since they have no FREAKING IDEA what theyre doing. MME limits have little to do with medicine and everything to do with politics. Relax and follow your doctors lead on this. 

I dont know a lot about this specific drug, its not used a whole lot anymore, since there are better ulcer drugs, but there is one old drug called Proglumide that can reverse opioid tolerance. You should ask your doc/look in to ""lowering opioid tolerance"". There is more than one way to skin a cat. What an awful expression...apologies for the ramble...Best of luck...",2,-0.9964

But I had a really bad experience at the end of last year where all my pain loci flared until I was in the er silently begging my dead dad to take me with him while getting lied to by medical providers.  I ended up back in the er ten hours later I think via ambulance because the pain made me vomit so much my potassium tanked and it was affecting my breathing (metabolic acidosis for all you medical nerds).  I was hospitalized for I think four days, all of which could have been prevented if I’d been admitted originally for pain management.  It was really disappointing because my local er has been so much better about pain management.  But it made me realize that my pain was too wide spread for a pump to be effective, it just took me some time to process pass the trauma enough to realize it was no longer an option for me.

I usually just see one of the PA’s for med refills and discussed it with her, she agreed I was right, now I’m going to have to make an appointment with the doc to figure out a new long term plan.

I’m not normal though,  I have EDS so the wound break down was more likely as was the reaction to the antibiotics.  I think they are appropriate for some and I was really optimistic about it.  In your shoes though I really would chance it.  The prep and recovery is a bitch too…ideally you need to be off all opiates for six week’s minimum but three months is preferred.  You can do bup but im to the point I need full mu agonist, not partial agonists/antagonists (sorry if that’s too pharmacology heavy).  I also only metabolize a handful of opiates on the market and they took my most effective away (I miss you oxymorphone).  It means I can’t rotate like I used to in order to keep my tolerance down and after several issues, including a PE, a MME of 90 just isn’t feasible.  I’m barely managing on 150.

I was born with 'undiagnosed' for years, twisted femurs which caused my knees to dislocate all the time. Each knee has now dislocated over 200x each, n because I refused to use anything to help me walk, I ended up doing irreparable damage. My pain in my legs started as a toddler, my knees started dislocating when I was in high-school, they eventually diagnosed my condition when I turned 30, I'm 50 now and have spent the last 12 yrs in bed, (I have many others problems than my legs).
While I get my leg problems are a bit extreme, all I'm trying to say is, if your having a typically bad day with your knee, use a cane or crutch etc to help to take some the pressure of your joint when walking. If you feel you don't need it some days then that's fine, go without. Just don't be to stubborn. Only you know your own body and when it's a bad day. I totally understand that's it hard as you don't want ppl thinking bad things about you, I was beaten and bullied at both junior and high school because they didn't understand what I was going through. I went to 1 reunion, and all ppl would say, apart from sorry, is, why didn't you tell us what was going on? Well I shouldn't have to for a start, but I do realise that explaining your knee pain to those who don't understand, may help stop anyone from having any bad thoughts about you, if they would've of course. I truly know as a chronic pain sufferer, we all tend to be a bit a paranoid. What is the dc thinking? What does friends think about me? Do I talk about my pain too much? Etc etc etc.

For a long time, I had this internalized able-ism about using mobility aids. But, the few times a month I go out, I would be suffering a lot more because of it. I had thoughts like, “I would be relying on a cane when I’m so young compared to others.” And blah blah blah. 

When I finally was like, “Fuck it!” And got the cane and rollator, my life has been better for it. Because of it, I was able to walk with Redwood trees at Henry Cowell SP, Forest of Nisene SP, and Muir Woods NM. I was able to revisit Yosemite NP and saw some waterfalls and a lake. And recently revisited Joshua Tree NP, and walked around an accessible path around a mountain lake yesterday. The cane has helped me go back to adventuring again compared to if I didn’t have it. 

So, I will always be supportive of canes and other mobility aids! 

Please, if you think it will help you live your life, get yourself a cane. But, also check in with an orthopedic doctor to make sure if anything is going on with your knee. And see a PT and watch tutorials about how to use it properly as well! 🙏💜",2,0.9811

The spring before last we were going to have to walk a number of blocks to our sons new hone. My wife was dreading it, so I suggested her using the cane and I tweaked the length / fit. She used it and discovered it was a magic wand . . . her being able to support / transfer her weight meant reduced pain and a better outing (On top of that - its presence caused people to treat her more nicely) She now uses it regularly and love how unique it looks (she was in my thought when I made it.)

From a different perspective.  Would using a cane put your spine and body out of alignment?  Talk with a  therapist about what will be the most help.  For me on days with a lot of walking expected, a walker is what offers the most balanced support with the added bonus of a seat to rest on when we stop to talk with others or my wife runs into just one more shop.

You can also ask them to consider Botox injections for the TMJ. I wouldn’t let just any dentist do them either. Get a neurologist and bring copies of your dental records.

I happen to know a young heavy weed smoker that has a vagnus nerve issue though its hard to say how much of that issue is from smoking and how much of it is from previously being on chemotherapy. Doctors are concerned that nerve issue may cause extremely serious sudden heart issues and shes having other nonlife threatening but concerning heart issues in the mean time.

Cannabis is a little complicated these days. If you're using a concentate, maybe a less potent  strain?

I think when I approached this 5 years ago that I was looking to get high and I thought by getting high ,that would relieve my pain.. but it's really the opposite  it's about finding the right terpene profile and the right strain and that is the issue... I suffer from debilitating spine pain I have degenerative disc disease my whole spine my whole lumbar spine I should say is a mess.. I suffer from mechanical low back pain it is so debilitating no oxy is going to take it fully away . It's a tough process because especially in Florida pain doctors don't want to see us  on both.. I'll tell you it's a tough deal when I feel bad for all of us that are suffering be it because of the DEA that we can't get what we need it's very difficult that's why I want to try to get away from opiates.. but don't let anybody tell you that you shouldn't be on it it's an FDA approved medication tramadol sucks for people in our shoes unless it's an added medication to another pain killer",1,-0.9952

I thought I had bad reactions to mmj before bc of long term use but later realized I was just using it to cope with serious health issues. Anyways I mean that when I stopped it was easier to get treatment also because people tend to demonize marijuana so if u go to a doctor saying ""I use mmj to cope with an undiagnosed health issue"" they are probably gonna start eyeing the mmj usage and so you will have to take a break at some point.

I’ve been dealing with health issues since my early 20s and had a physically abusive brother and emotionally and verbally abusive dad. It was so bad with my brother that he actually came at me before and after surgeries and when I was seriously ill. 

I was in law school and had 7 surgeries and my dad would freak out at me and not understand why I “couldn’t be a normal law student”.  Things were really toxic for me and I spent almost ten years waiting for a diagnosis that the doctors couldn’t figure out. I was actually told that western medicine couldn’t do anything and good luck. Luckily I went to a place that did iV treatment of vitamins and silver and that saved my life. But during that time I felt like I was so misunderstood and I just wanted the toxicity to stop. 

I hope you find the right Dr and that they figure it out. Don’t be afraid to go to specialists because primary drs really don’t know. And then if that specialist doesn’t work out they can refer you. It takes so much to wake up and be in pain and deal with a very toxic environment. 

My parents still help me out financially but I’ve figured out a way where if I just see my dad for less than an hour and a half at a time like once a month I can get through it. Also trauma therapy was the best thing I could’ve done because not only did I focus on the abuse but also the medical trauma.

It seems to have a lot to do with pain  experiences. Everyone  seems to base how severe  pain is  by comparison to  the  worst pain experience.  Which really makes these  pain  scales  meaningless.

If you take a look at any medical report or  notes, you'll see  that doctors only use 3 grades for severity - mild, moderate, or severe.  When people talk about these  pain  scales,  I am  often reminded of the scene  in the  movie  Spinal Tap,  where they have the  ""special""  amplifier  that  goes  up to  11.  Its  more than 10 so  it  must be better ....

Doctors always want a number from  1-10.  And then  they  ignore it.  Which isn't  necessarily a bad  thing,  if they are going ask  you about your pain and listen to you. It's  hard sometimes, but your  own words are going to tell  them more about what's going on  than  any number  will...hang in there.",7,-0.9379
1kncrdl,msh7miu,Meikou133,2025-05-15 16:56:37,"So, I had a prepared childbirth but was on Pitocin drip. I also did get an epidural. I have Fibromyalgia, scoliosis, and chronic migraines. I also likely have the beginning of arthritic pains or something but getting diagnosed young is a bitch. 

Labor sucked, but was about as bad as a Fibromyalgia flare, I’ll give it that with those things as factors (pitocin and epidural). I also had PROM so my waters broke very early on in labor despite being less than 2cm dilated. 

But what was FAR more painful, was finding out the epidural was partially failed and a hemorrhage leading me to need an EXCESSIVE fundal massage. I felt all of it despite them bolusing me like, three times, and my feet being completely unmovable. It was reaching some parts, but not others. They were elbow deep into my uterus with another hand on the outside grinding down to try to stop the bleeding. For an hour. It was and is still the most painful experience in my life. So if it’s that kind of childbirth, then yea. This should be WAY higher. 

Perhaps a category of “birth with complications” should be added. 

Still though - most people can’t do a lot during childbirth, because it is painful, and anything you are doing is usually to find a way to relive pain (getting up to walk around, stretching, breathing exercises, etc.) and the same I feel goes for Fibro. So if this scale is assessing level of ability while affected by the pain, I think it makes sense. 

One factor it does not account for, though, is time period. 

Sure, arthritic aches aren’t horrible. But if it’s that level, all day, for several days to weeks? That wears on a person. 

Childbirth is temporary. It ends. Even kidney stones do eventually(CKD notwithstanding). But there’s a reason a known torture method is a single drop of water dripping over and over in the same spot. It’s not about how intense the sensation is, it’s about the CONSTANCE of it. Even a single drop of water becomes horribly unbearable when it just keeps going.

 I read somewhere about kratom.

I wake up moaning nearly every night. I’m in a lupus flare right now, so it’s been multiple times a night. I’m lucky in that my PCP, who prescribes my pain meds, which also makes me lucky, added another dose for these occasions. 

With you being pregnant, I don’t even know how/if they are prescribing anything for your pain. Pregnant women can take pain killers, I did with multiple kidney infections during my first pregnancy, but definitely with extreme care and moderation. (It was a LONG time ago and things were much different then.)

I have a question, but I’ll explain why I’m asking it first. My body sometimes “protects” me from pain by barely moving while I’m sleeping. I guess it figures if movement hurts, I shouldn’t move. The problem with this is that my joints and muscles hurt even worse when I wake up from being still the whole night. It’s especially bad in my elbows. Is this happening to you? 

If so, if your husband wakes up to you crying or moaning, maybe he can gently move you. Mine does this and it helps. 

Please talk to your rheumatologist, or whoever handles your pain management. You need the sleep with chronic illness as it is, not to mention growing a whole human. Maybe they could prescribe something you can take on just those occasions.

I’m not sure if pregnant women can use Voltaren gel, but rubbing some into your hips before bed might also be helpful. (It’s an NSAID in a gel. The more you rub it in, the better it works.)

1kn4eq7,msfeamf,StayxxFrosty,2025-05-15 10:50:31,"I would want to get an opinion from a rheumatologist or 3 before getting any more surgeries.

I have seronegative & HLAB27 negative ankylosing spondylitis and it presented as mechanical back problems early on that progressively got worse over time. 

About 5 to 6 years from symptom onset I herniated S1-L3. S1-L5 was a good sized herniation, the other two were small. The rad report glossed over them, so I was never offered the option for surgeons referral from my GP, and honestly thank God because I might be in a much worse place having taken it. Having an autoimmune arthritis makes surgery alot more risky. 

I found this out taking my MRI to a spine biomechanics researcher, but he still advised me to try and avoid surgery and instead try to manage via exercise & improving my spine hygiene (all the behaviors that contribute to your spine health - mostly movement / posture based). 

If you're interested the spine health protocol this guy taught me is detailed in the book Back Mechanic by Stewart McGill.

Aside from that with respect to your most recent herniation coinciding with a bout of food poisoning - I've heard anecdotally (forget where I heard tbh) that some people with back pain have their spine infected with bacterial infection that can be treated with a shot of antibiotics. I'm not sure that explains the herniations, but could be some condition is weakening the overall structural integrity of your spine and making your more susceptible to herniations.",1,-0.8686

I have also read the back mechanic and found it very helpful, but one thing he mentioned was if you symptoms are all the time then its probably time to consider surgery, his book actually convinced me to have surgery!  When I had to food poisoning I actually went to urgent care 3 days later because I was still so nauseous and they did blood work since I was only 4 weeks post op and it came back all normal.

I have read MANY case reports, and papers from medical journals all the way back to the 1930s that PROVE beyond a doubt that these herniations can mimic sciatic pain, and even lumbar disc herniations.  There are case reports of people having surgeries for lumbar disc problems and getting ZERO relief, but after they had the back mice removed, and the tear in the fascia repaired, they were 90-100% better.  IF you end up getting these removed, it is best to consult with a pastic surgeon and/or dermatologist, as they're MUCH more likely to know about these, and plastic surgeons are highly skilled and able to repair the fascial tear correctly so that they are less likely to return in the future.",1,0.818

People need to do scans so they're serious mad medical doctors ignore a lot of our pain migraine's real eye pain is real much eye pain is correlated with migraines I feel for you I know it's real I've been told by ridiculous doctors that when I was younger that my migraines were fake I had a egocentric neurologist that said he could cure everything he couldn't find him I agree that he's never cure he was short little arrogant man he told me the journal everything. I've been up biomed student overachiever artist and very very good at research so I had a journal with pictures that I drew because at 5 years old my parents have gotten me a Gray's anatomy book not the movie there's actually a book called Gray's anatomy hers horses Gray's anatomy of the human body that's what doctors use in fats I learned to draw from those. My color coded my migraine pain correlated with my period it also correlated with muscle and tendon problems. I went to the neurologist when I had this terrible migraine and took my journal with because he kept it everywhere and it was color coded , with the pictures to match. Cuz I drew he said I was insane as he went around throwing papers inside this office I was at the window saying I was a fiasco the guy had a little fit in his office. And then went to the emergency room my migraine was bad and had it for days some of them I'd have for up to 5 days at that time I didn't have a good doctor I was young I was only 25. I had migraines since I was 15 but that 25 they got too bad I was in the biomed program I had stress bad stress my periods came around the migraines got worse my stress got my worse my shoulder pain got worse and then my migraines. In the yard doctor believed me she even called me up and followed up the next day she said do you mind if I keep the journal I have a friend I'm having lunch with that studying from Germany and is on a fellowship here a grand. I love her keep it and this doctor called me was a weird German accent said he wanted to see me he knew what I had and he'd been studying up for years. Because of my obsessive compulsiveness because of my drawings and my journal this guy from Germany said as he gave me a pamphlet this is what you have fibromyalgia there's a library on the second floor it's usually for doctors but here's the number go in study what you have write down what you need some of the books so you can learn about it it's not in your head it's an actual disease that I'm trying to get more information on and get the world to follow and I'd like to keep your journal for my study and my research. I was so grateful for a diagnosis 
Because all these idiots had said it was in my head they look at me like I needed a new dress like I was crazy I finally got a diagnosis. Two doctors that believe me one that was leaving unfortunately to go back to Germany but he believed me and he found the diagnosis. From then on I ended up getting a good doctor for 30 years but when the fibromyalgia advanced some of the migraines went away for years and then when the fibromyalgia advance they came back because fibromyalgia advances with age and gets worse. Now I have other diseases and headaches are back but my body won't respond to the migraine medicine anymore it's not in your head. If you can start charting this stuff if you can draw start drawing where you perceive the pain to be there might even be pre-drawn figures of the face the head different angles. So you don't have to drive like I did. It's a pain to keep a journal but you need it for legal reasons make sure there's lots of paper connected to a book called a journal with lines so you can draw and lines that you can write the appointments and what the doctor say and if they say it's all in your head right that down date time doctor so and so said it's all in my head walked out was very disrespectful make that note and then when your headache starts or any symptoms you're going to have symptoms mine was shoulder pain. Dan severe neck spasms and then my face behind my eye would hurt so bad on the left I couldn't take it 
There is now a treatment for migraines coming out it uses a pap machine. To freeze the sinuses behind the sinuses are a ganglion of nerves once those nerves are frozen too I think negative 34°, the migraine goes away in 2 hours which is why when you strep ice to your head and to the front of your face wherever the migraine is later for 12 hours you should be able to hear your sinuses pop and the migraines start to reduce and swelling depending on how long you've had the migraine 
I've had my migraine treated with steroids after I had it for 28 days and I had fluid on my head inside my skull 
It showed on MRI 
Images or what you need if they don't believe that there's anything there then ask him to do images have him do it on a day where you have a migraine 
I'm not sure what the best image is but MRI is a really good CT scans are the second but they're not as good as an MRI. No it's not in your head trust me things are swelling for a reason the brain itself doesn't have nerves but the lining around the brain swells and when it presses against the skull causes pain. Send me a request to chat if it allows you to we can chat 
I'll always respond to request it's not in your head trust me don't let people tell you it is. There are treatments icing with a pap machine is probably 5 years away 
And you probably have something in there that needs to be corrected or taken out or that swells when people doing the MRI when you don't have a migraine it can't be seen. They probably need hormone and then lab test too and I don't know if you have the money for that 
If you have a good insurance policy. Pictures policy I have right now is crud 
I'm hoping that I can get the past history because I was at the point where people were injecting my skull in the nerves around my skull with lidocaine 
The medicine I was taking wasn't helping the migraines it was actually causing heart reactions. But that's on my migraines had advanced a few years ago. German years I went with Maxsalt and they helped my migraines. But these new migrants that I got after the 28th day one and being in the hospital they're different. Fibromyalgia changes as you get older I'm not sure why but I have a lot of allergies that are weird I have these migraines now that last days and after the migraines I can't just get up and start new a day or two after the migraines there's like a light migraine and a severe feeling of sadness and like the world doesn't exist it's a physical connection and emotional disconnection and I don't have emotional problems. But I believe you please DM me we can talk more it's not all in your head.",2,-0.9973

 I have fibromyalgia and was not diagnosed for years but i absolutely wanted all the tests done to rule out another cause and eventually i got access to a doctor who took me seriously enough to check.

The only way ATM to get an hEDS diagnosis is via a private consultant rheumatologist with a specialism in hypermobility, they can see what is wrong with you. It's max 400 GBP. They are booked up in advance, some up to six weeks.

However once you get this diagnosis the NHS won't help anyway as there is no treatment or cure. It's up to you to find a special PT and you are left to fend for yourself. That's it, maybe one PT session if lucky and pain management appointment maybe every six months.

I'm sorry you were dismissed. Your pain seems very real and those drs seem lazy. You could do some research into testing and scans and insist from your Dr.  If they refuse, tell them you want their refusal marked on your medical records. That usually works well to get them to order them.

The longest and most frustrating phase was the pain management clinic, which is where hopes for diagnosis go to die. I experienced it as kind of an “end of the road” referral, because they had absolutely 0 curiosity about the origin of my pain. Meanwhile, I was in my 20s and feeling pretty damn curious about why I could no longer function. This is to say — don’t let pain management get you down and don’t expect a diagnosis from them, because they won’t give you one. You’re going to need to see more specialists, unfortunately. 

As for me, I was ultimately diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I know you think you don’t have it and I defer to your judgment, but I want to tell you that I didn’t develop full-blown classic fibromyalgia-patterned pain right away. It started with pain in my cheeks. I thought I had chronic sinusitis. Then they thought it was my jaw. Over the ensuing months, the pain slowly spread to the rest of my face, then my neck, then my wrists, knees, hips, feet… I wouldn’t have met a fibro diagnosis at the onset of my pain because it hadn’t fully expressed itself yet. 

I very much hope that your pain has fully expressed itself and that you won’t have any more. I thought my life was basically over once the pain set in. And it was very bad for a few years. But weirdly, the pain has essentially gone away over the last 2 years. I have no idea why.

Till you become tolerant to the new medication, in which case they can just go back to what youre using now. It doesnt really have to be stronger, just different, something the receptors are not saturated by.

A high dose is a relative thing. When you break a 1000MME give a shout. If you can manage the side effects, its not a high dose. Im a little concerned however, about coming off as bad mouthing your doc, so bear with me...

Suboxone is drug combination of an opioid called Buprenorphine, and a small dose of narcan to make anything other than taking it orally, a most unpleasant experience. Its an abuse resistant drug, thats mostly used for substance use disorders. There is no abuse proof drug. Doctors have taken to using suboxone to treat pain because they feel the ""drug police"" give it less scrutiny and its scheduled lower than most analgesics.

They make about 347 different types of buprenorphine drugs that are not used to treat substance use disorders. You should ask your doc if they are trying to tell you something. Its a little infuriating that they always suggest suboxone when there are so many other buprenorphine based drugs that arent suggested for substance abuse. Buprenorphine pills patches and assorted potions. I see this, the doctor is either uninformed about suboxone and buprenorphine, or theyre doing it deliberately which means they think...well, its hard to know what docs think. But it is suggestive of something. Hopefully its just an oversight. 


Im not too sure about the Botox, did they try anything else, like a local anesthetic? It wont last as long as botox might, but it should make your muscles droopy without damaging the nerve tissue. If the local helps, the botox would likely work as well but for longer.

I have been with him for about 12 years. 2)He is very genuine and we talk openly . If he thought that, he would not hide that information. . There is no reason to and it would be unethical not to. It is a medical diagnosis and nothing to be ashamed of. If he genuinely thought a patient  had OUD, he would gently bring it up as a medical/safely concern. . He isn’t trying to be “tricky”.

And maybe it was my wording, but he is not refusing to increase itfurther, he is reluctant.We both  want to find a better alternative .

I  have been on them for many years and have a tolerance.

1kmpwia,msi421q,Old-Goat,2025-05-15 19:34:38,"A gram of  morphine is still a  big  dose.  Most doctors would discuss an implanted medication pump  before the dose gets that high.  Usually the constipation from that amount of medication would likely be problematic before the dose gets that big.

I have been at this pain thing a long time.  I remember true  big  doses.  I knew a guy in  Hawaii that was on 3gms of morphine, I'd have to double check the amount., but II believe that's  the biggest dose  I  heard of. 

Yeah, those were different days.  Before police and politicians decided they knew more about pain management  than the doctors.  It's no longer pain management,  it's become malpractice.  Actually, it's practicing without a medical license, but why quibble? It's wrong and it's dangerous. 

What  happened to change medication doses so  dramatically?  Did   pain  suddenly start to  hurt less? Did they come up with some magic drugs that treat pain so much more efficiently?  How do they get a 4 hour.drug. to last  all day?  They don't.  Not all medical jokes are funny. 

So why are patients today given 1/4 of what used to  an adequate dose?  Little wonder so many people who first take an opioid for pain ask what the big deal is. It's often  like  ""This is what the fuss was about?"""" Because they're on less than half of what the dose should be. 

Rx addiction is extremely rare.  The numbers have been studied extensively, as you might imagine from all the rhetoric.  Rx opioid addiction has a rate between 0.25% and 0.50%.  Not quite the 80% most people believe.  I apologize if this is upsetting to addicts in the sub, but they are the numbers from the agencies that declared an opioid crisis. 

They just left out the part that they meant different opioids, street drugs, not prescriptions. Why would they do that? Just look at the ""success"" they have had trying to control street drugs and illicit Fentanyl . One might even say if it wasn't for all the attention given to Rx drugs,  they have accomplished very little. So the DEA  had to wipe their asses on patients. They're  done  little else for the  past 40 years. They have gotten very good at it.  I guess once you have blood on your hands, how much  doesn't matter...

A few things in response. . 

1) I have tried a bunch of opioid switches recently and tried all the mainstream opioids  and end up on higher dose than I was on with the previous opioid I do not get any side effects. I am in Canada , and the watchful dose  is 90mg of morphine equivalent per day. Docs of course can go higher. . made a mistake in my calculations. My dose is closer to350 mg.  But you mentioned a gram of morphine per day. I have only heard of two  patients on that dose (I mean  for chronic non cancer pain and not palliative. ) . That seems like a lot to me. I have recently just switched  opioids I am already heading to half gram.My pain is pretty bad though. At the dose I am on I can att BEST get to a 6!on movement and a 5 at rest. That is becoming rare though. My pain is just increasing and usually it is MUCH worse. Like 7-8 at rest. Today I am doing better at rest. Like. 5. It is a bit of a relief. 
 
2)My doc knows me well and knows I don’t have addiction problems.Bupinorphine  by itself and the like, is not as available here in Canada like it is the USA. And the ones we have are super expensive. We tried  getting it from the US to no avail. The only wayI  can go on a med without the narcqn for free or at a reasonable price  is if I went to a clinic that treats opioid use disorder. He says he doesn’t want me to go that route  I don’t have that and even if I did go and say I had it, (just to have it covered) i would not want it on my chart in case in the future, another doc assumed I had OUD and it affected treatment. . Idk why that would be used at a  treatment center . . One would think a med with narcan would be used. Maybe just easier for a tx  center to get it and have it covered.My doctor is sincere and open. If he thought I had OUD, I feel he would say it and try to do anything to help. any of his patients suffering OUD . He also suggested I smoke cannibis . It is legal here, but It did not help and just made me nauseated and dizzy. I tried it a few times.

3) o I get an about 40 steroid injection every 3 weeks or so and anesthesia.in  between. The steroids do help for about 4-5 days ar miost. I am hoping for longer and better relief with Botox, but am nervous

1kmpgve,msc6e5z,hannibalsmommy,2025-05-14 20:59:24,"I think your priority here isn't the possibility of addiction; it is living a less painful life. That needs to be your priority. Definitely talk to your new doctor, about these fears & concerns. Whether your doctor goes the opiod route, or SSRI/SNRI route, or anti-inflammatory med route, they are all difficult to come off of, to greater or lesser degrees. Your pain takes precedence over everything right now, if it is affecting your day to day life. 

Also, make sure you carry hardcopies of all your results with you to your appointment: bloodwork, x-rays, MRIs, bone scans, CT scans, doctors notes, etc. Do not trust that ""the system"" has transferred it all to your new doctor, because chances are, it will not have been transferred. 

In my vast experience with having to go to many doctors this past 5 years since becoming sick, I've learned the hard way... that my medical information does not transfer from doctor to doctor to doctor. And if you want your pain management doctor to treat you properly, you need to bring all of your medical documentation with you.

I take diazepam for anxiety. At night I take Tizanidine which is a muscle relaxer that my pain management doctor prefers. It can be very sedating but it wears off quickly. The worst sedating period is about 1/2 an hour after you take it until about two hours after. Rarely when my pain is really not responding to my usual pain meds I take the Tizanidine during the day and can stay awake. 

I have been on diazepam for a long time. Dependent for sure, not addicted. Never raised my dose. Ever. My anxiety is horrific. I’m sure it helps with my pain to some degree. It is a great drug with one massive drawback: people hate prescribing it. Edit to add: diazepam can be highly addictive and is dangerous when mixed with other sedating meds. Saying its only drawback is that it’s hard to get prescribed was really irresponsible of me. In my case its benefits outweigh its risks since I have managed it for so long without issues but as a new medicine it should be taken very seriously.

Tizanidine is not a controlled substance. I don’t believe it can be addictive. I have read of people who had side effects they didn’t like so start with a low dose if you choose to try it. Flexeril did nothing at all for me. I know it puts some people right out.",2,-0.9873

This is very likely a HIPAA violation. If they relay any protected healthcare information, it violates HIPAA. If so, be  sure you and your loved ones are prepared  to counter this illegal activity. 

If you live in a one party consent state you can record them without their  knowledge or consent. Record any encounters where you suspect they might violate your rights to privacy. BUT be absolutely 100% positive that you DO NOT record any other patient or any other innocent bystander, because you will be sued. 

 Hospitals, doctors, and other medical staff cannot legally record you because, as a patient, you have every expectation of privacy. They do not!  

If you live in a one party consent state, you can secretly record them without their knowledge or consent. Then you can consult an attorney, and sue the hospital and anyone else involved. 

Recording patients violates HIPAA, so you'll want to consult the absolute best healthcare and HIPAA attorney money can buy! A good attorney will take the case on contingency BUT you need to do one thing before talking to any attorney! 

Any time you're hiring an attorney, the first question you should always ask should be:

Do you have any conflict of interest suing (and then say the name of the hospital and any person involved, which might include any doctor or healthcare worker involved). If you don't ask, they don't have to tell you and they can also inform the hospital and any involved parties. So always ask before giving them any further information! 

If you don't know any good attorneys or practices, you can ask a friend or coworker if you don't trust anyone to advise you, you can check a site like:

www.superlawyers.com

I say hire the best lawyers money can buy because a good lawyer will make the other party pay for everything -- your legal fees, your court costs, and your medical bills. They violated your rights to privacy and confidentiality. 

In addition, if you're being treated for substance use disorder they've created an even bigger problem because people being treated for substance use disorder / addiction have even greater rights to privacy and confidentiality than any other patient population. I won't go into that here because it's  another situation altogether.

It took me almost 10 years of chronic pain to understand something very precious for - we are in the business of creating liberation from suffering. The physical and emotional turmoil informs my work and creates a curiosity within me that forces me into deeper places that could have taken decades to surface. My attachment to suffering, how it plays out in my life, how I feel in the presence of it has been a pillar of my work and I wouldn’t for a moment wish something else was in its place. Something that we all understand, chronically or not, is pain. When we look pain and suffering directly in the face, it changes. When we create informed by our experience of such a deeply heavy human experience such as chronic illness we are liberating ourselves AND others. 

It’s not the end for you. This is the touchstone for growth beyond your wildest dreams.

We do know there are risks. This is abundantly obvious from anecdotal evidence and case reports. It can be highly addictive, and anyone who says that’s “only the extracts” is probably suffering from a personal bias. In powder form, consider that you end up consuming _large_ quantities of plant matter that is entirely unregulated. You don’t know what’s in it. There could be anything from illegal pesticides to heavy metals, and both of those are very bad for you. There’s a reason cannabis has mandatory testing for those things in places where it’s legal and regulated. 

Having said all of that, I recognize that in the US we have a very serious problem with availability of proper pain medications. I read the stories on here daily. As I’ve mentioned on here several times, I am writing a book about chronic pain and so I’ve been doing tons of research. There will be an entire chapter on kratom, because for a lot of people it ends up being their only available option to get back some quality of life. 

We deserve better than kratom. No one should be put in a position where it’s their only option. I fully understand why people take it, but I don’t think anyone is going to claim it is _better_ than pharmaceuticals. 

It’s also interesting to me - and this is something I’m digging into - that in spite of the known properties of these alkaloids there has been little effort to turn it into a pharmaceutical. There are some existing patents, and metabolites have been researched because they’re less toxic. The demand for safer pain medication is very high, and if the kratom alkaloids were safe enough to make it through regulatory hurdles I think it probably would have happened already.",12,-0.9866

Not all of them are tested for mold and Mycotoxins




It can work great for many people, it just needs to be treated with respect. 


 -IT [mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine] IS AN OPIOD!!!!-


I can't process raw leaf so i have to use extracts that taste so bad they make me want to puke or other stronger products like 7-hydroxymitragynine which is synthesized from mitragynine that's extracted kratom.


Both the extracts and the 7-hydroxymitragynine are addictive. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise. They'd be lying. 


I use the stuff a few times a month when I can't manage my pain with other stuff like my prescribed ketamine. cbd/cbg/thc blends that help my neuropathy and chronic pain only go so far.


I had a wedding to go to and it lined up with some of my really bad days. I used kratom extract for 4 days. Maybe i took a little too much, you have to figure out your own dosing. When i got back home where I could just lay in bed in pain and didn't have to walk which exacerbates it, i stopped taking it. We'll i got the shits, cramps, a bit of sweat
.. for about 4 days to a week I felt ill. So it can get you dependent very fast in some use cases. The 7-hydroxymitragynine products are even worse in that regard. They'll get you dependent even faster. 




There would be zero difference if they were selling hydrocodone or morphine[asidec from those suppressbreathing so they're more dangerous]. People would still get hooked. It's a huge difference from heroin or fentanyl though. Kratom doesn't suppress breathing making overdose very different. When you stop breathing from opiates, that's how they kill you. So it's very different in that regard. You can still overdose and from what I understand it takes a stupid amount. 


I see it as SIGNIFICANTLY SAFER! It is literally harm reduction for many people. 


So if your are thinking of killing yourself or trying to get anything to kill the pain, yeah go to the headshops, not the alleys behind them. It's expensive and better prices are found online but you won't get laced 7-hydroxymitragynine or laced kratom like you will get laced dope and pressed pills elsewhere in the back alley.


It is addictive. You will become dependent if you keep taking it. That means withdrawing when you stop, one of those withdrawals is BONE AND JOINT PAIN, meaning for chronic pain patients it'll be even harder to get off once dependent.






Treat it like poison and take it the least you can. 






I don't believe it's right to put anyone down for using this stuff anymore than it is to put someone down using prescribed stuff. A prescription vs no prescription is not the definition of a drug addiction. The alternatives are killing people (fentanyl is now one of the SAFER things out there, nitrazines and other fentalogs make it look like tylenol and that's not even getting into the issues with the xylazene and other stuff it's laced with. There are many people who use those drugs for pain. The need for pain relief and drug addiction are separate issues that can Halen at the same time. Just like there are people here who enjoy their pain pills beyond them just killing pain. It's no different.


If you remove kratom and 7-hydroxymitragynine products all you'll have are doctors with rx's and drug dealers with worse drugs. If someone with a past history of drug use gets hit by a car, needs pain management and can't get it from a doctor... where do you suppose they'll go? With kratom and 7-hydroxymitragynine there's at least some fentanyl free options that won't kill people like fent is doing now.

I read lab tests myself because many like, smoke shop brands, use labs that aren’t reputable. I also know where my Kratom comes from and they include a batch number. But many brands and online stores do not offer up this information, aren’t transparent about their source, or don’t use good labs to test it. 

It’s also addictive but it really depends on the person, withdrawal seems to vary wildly between users. I used it daily for a year and quit for a few months, and just had some extra fatigue for a couple of days which sucked. But overall, I found quitting cold turkey to be pretty doable. I have heard from others that they had pretty intense withdrawal symptoms. It doesn’t bond to opiate receptors in the way opiates do, so I find it to be a little bit of a stretch to call it an opiate the way I’ve seen people call it. It is opioid like, it is a partial agonist instead of a full agonist, and doesn’t bond to all of the same receptors. 

Its effects are dose dependent, it made me pretty nauseous at first but I also have chronic nausea so that’s expected. I haven’t been able to get much for pain outside of some gabapentin and so I got desperate. I had to quit thc as it began to cause insane anxiety. The biggest risk I have found is that it’s unregulated so you must do a lot of research on where you get it from. It’s cheap especially from the reputable sources compared to the vape store crap. 

Try at your own risk. The few overdoses it’s caused often involved other substances, or obscenely high doses. Not saying a pure Kratom OD can’t happen, but its risk is nothing compared to opioids. It’s been a god send for me honestly. I have gotten labs done to check in on my liver, or to test to see if there are heavy metals in my system, and it’s always come back good. I rarely tell people I take it as I find I’m treated like a full blown addict. I used to abuse alcohol and small doses of Kratom allowed me to stay sober for over a year so far.

I make a thick tea out of it and add cinnamon and other spices to tame the gross flavor. In order to go overboard and risk dependence/addiction, you would have to take tons of it, intentionally.

If you are epileptic for example, or have Grand Mal seizures, it may not be worth it. Is this to say it's definitely going to cause seizures? No. But it lowers the threshold and thus makes one more likely. 

Aside from seizures, your source. Anything from a gas station or smoke shop should already raise red flags. Also. AVOID 7-oH at all costs. It is the equivalent of taking Oxycodone, bypassing metabolization by your liver, and getting pure Oxymorphone. 

TLDR;

Source Kratom from reputable sources who actually test for heavy metals and are trustworthy. Realize that those ""7-oH"" pills are simply 7-hydroxymitragynine. This is an alkaloid that is present when you take Kratom regularly. 

I've seen people take that stuff for only 2 weeks and be full-on addictied. If you're using the Kratom for pain, Red Bali, Red Maeng Da, basically all Red strains are better than Green. Green strains are better for focus or attention issues and give more of an energy boost. 

If you're at risk for seizures, look into it more. If you've never had issues with seizures, take it slow and take as little as required for your pain.

Helps a ton, I have no issues with it. Sometimes I take white kratom mixed with adderall as an upper when I really, really need to get work done for the next 10 hours, but that's rarely. 

The big difference in terms of risk of addiction is dose. I know that sounds obvious, but there is a certain culture of 'dose doesnt really matter, it wont kill you!' attitude among kratom users, especially when it comes to starting doses. People say to start at 3-5g often. They will often talk about taking as much as 10g+ and 'being fine' (hint: they are almost always not fine). 

3-5g is a *very high level to start with.* Kratom, as with all opiate and opiate-like drugs, has drastically different effects on different people. Some people get straight up high off of 1-2g, others don't feel anything from 5g and need more. Those people who are highly sensitive to opiates and are starting at higher levels (because a forum told them to) will end up getting addicted very fast. 

Basically, its almost entirely morons or people who got misled by bullshit spread on kratom forums who end up addicted. I don't mean for that to sound harsh, but its true.

1km8yao,mspzrpv,mtysassy,2025-05-17 01:00:34,"My ENT explained that what causes the narrowing is scar tissue at the top of the trachea. Sometimes the cause is unknown and sometimes it happens when you’re intubated or from reflux. Mine is most likely caused by a combination of intubation and reflux. The results are immediate-I can breathe as soon as I come out of surgery. I have a harder time recovering from the anesthesia than I do the actual procedure. I usually sleep the entire next day. 

Even when they repair and dilate it, the body perceives it as an injury and starts making scar tissue again. I think it’s typical for most people to have to have a few surgeries close together in the beginning and the results gradually last longer and longer. 

The injections are quite an ordeal but it’s worth it to me to stay out of the OR. First I get lidocaine sprayed in one nostril. While waiting for that to start working, he gives me a shot of lidocaine in my throat-that deadens it a little so the steroid doesn’t hurt as bad going in. After it starts working, they put the scope down. Once the scope is down, the doctor looks in and finds my vocal cords and inserts the needle. The first shot makes you cough violently and the coughing disperses medicine to numb the inside of your throat. When your throat is numb, the doctor puts the steroid shot in and injects it into the scar tissue. My doctor has a monitor on the wall so you can watch everything as he’s doing it. My doctor always teases that he’s going to do a YouTube video of me as an instructional for other patients. He says that he’s had men sit and cry and can’t go through with it. My philosophy is that I can endure almost anything for a few minutes as long as I know it’s going to end soon.

You can always see another doctor without leaving your current doctor setup to share your concerns.  No two doctors are going to handle a situation the same way, so you may find one that agrees that going back to your previous dose is a better solution.  I personally would never switch from traditional pain medication to suboxone or methadone, but to each their own.  The doctors that are currently pushing for this aren't doing it from a patient care standpoint, they're doing it because they want to write less traditional opioid scripts and they're incentivized in many cases to get patients to switch.  Unless there's a lot of medical evidence/agreement that a switch is better at treating your actual pain, it's not being done so in your best interest.  But it's also important to consider that moving a patient back to a higher mg or more frequent doses just because that's what they had before isn't usually something doctors agree on.  Moving from every 6 hours to every 4 hours, or vice versa in your case, isn't considered a major change.  So I wouldn't lead with the idea that ""they had me on this before and I was dependent"".

I’m dealing with chronic pain too (in my case from an old injury + fibro), and the cycle of “Here, try gabapentin again” feels like some kind of bad joke at this point. It’s frustrating how limited and repetitive the options are — especially when some of them either don’t help or make things worse.

I’m also on LDN and agree — it's not perfect, but it's helped enough that I don’t want to mess with it. And same with cannabis — it’s not a magic fix, but some days it’s the only thing that takes the edge off enough for me to function or sleep.

A few things that helped me, just in case it sparks an idea:

* Gentle myofascial release stuff (even short sessions helped calm flare-ups).
* Rotating heat/cold on joints + Epsom soaks — especially on rough weather days.
* Tiny “movement snacks” instead of longer exercise routines — stuff like slow joint circles and wall-supported stretches.

None of it replaces real treatment, but a few little adjustments gave me back a small sense of control — which feels like a win some days.

If I were you, I would follow a routine designed by a professional instead of trying to make one up yourself. All routines will work if you consistently put in the effort and have a good diet, but a routine written by a professional will get you to where you need to go more efficiently than one you make up yourself.

Your routine specifically is honestly missing a lot.

For your routine specifically:

1. You are doing way too much in one day. As Patton said, 41 sets in a single session is a lot, and I don't believe that you are really putting 100% effort into all of your sets. I personally do between 18-24 sets per workout, and any more than that I start to really sandbag my stuff. 

2. On top of that, you are doing this 5 times a week? So not only are you doing an insane amount of work every workout, but you are also doing it almost every day. I would be worried that you are doing a lot of volume that isn't actually helping you progress to your goals. I strongly recommend decreasing the amount that you are doing and trying to really truly give 100% effort to your sets. For some perspective, I normally do ~100 weekly sets. 

3. Despite all of this volume, you are missing a vertical pulling movement. You say you want to develop your upper body, but your back is a significant part of your upper body and requires more volume than your chest. At the very least you need a vertical pull.

4. You are missing any hamstring or hip hinge work all together.

5. You are missing calf work, direct ab training, and rear delt isolation work. These don't matter nearly as much, but if you are going to run a workout where you are doing this many exercises you should cover all your bases.",2,0.7701
1kpfmr0,msy8u4n,Patton370,2025-05-18 13:26:08,"That’s 41 sets in a single session. You say you’re going close to failure, but unless you’re doing a morning workout, then an evening workout… I bet your either sandbagging the later sets or the later sets are much less weight/reps than your earlier sets 

I have an extremely high work capacity, and even I can’t handle more than 30 hard sets in a single session. Unless I want to start taking 10 minutes rest between sets at the end lol 

My advice is to still do full body but have:

Workout A 

Workout B 

Workout C (could even have a workout D if you wanted) 

So week 1 would be: ABCAB 

Week 2: CABCA 

And so on 

Vary the exercises you do each workout

Side note. You have no hip hinge movement or hamstring work. Do kickstand RDLs or RDLs on at least one of those days (you not having that in your plan is another indicator that 41 sets is too much for you in a day) 

Side note 2x: 205 sets in a week is wild. That’s more working sets than I’ve ever done, and I run higher volume than 95%+ of people who lift",1,-0.2012
1kpfmr0,msyj95e,cgesjix,2025-05-18 14:27:11,You'd be better off doing something like Lyle McDonalds generic bulking routine instead of making your own. 3x3 on main lifts and 5x8-10 on deadlifts followed by 4 sets of leg press tells me you're not taking advice on bodybuilding from bodybuilders.

1kpfmr0,msyafcb,Patton370,2025-05-18 13:36:06,"Day 1: 8 exercises and 27 sets is a bit ambitious for upper 1. You really don’t need 4 variations of bench like that. Drop at least one completely (my advice would be to make CG your BBB sets & drop the extra regular bench) 

Day 2: Bulgarian split squats would be a better main. I’d suggest dropping the volume a bit here too. Maybe 3 sets of each on RDL and hip thrusts? Do less if you can’t keep a good intensity 

Day 3: honestly, you could take a row variation from this day & add it to day 1. Then take a bench variation from day 1 and add it to day 3 

Day 4: Id suggest dropping the accessories to 2 or 3 sets. 8 sets of deadlifts is pretty fatiguing 

General note: You’re going hard on the volume. Make sure you keep intensity at an adequate level and are progressively overloading. Extremely high volume can work well (it’s what I do), but most people I see that try to run this many accessories with as many compounds you’re doing… end up sandbagging the accessories",2,0.8201

1kpfmr0,msyrg0b,fycROMAN,2025-05-18 15:11:03,"I see I see, so I really really need to lower my sets while still using all of my effort and probably split up the exercises into multiple routines like Patton said. Got it.

I do a few sets of pull ups 4 days a week at work as well but they are more spread out and just a conditioning thing. But I like them, so I should probably just find a way to install a pull up bar at home it sounds like. And I'll be adding RDLs for now for hamstring and hip hinge as patton suggested

I've tried finding professional routines but after trying a bunch of dumbbell ones, I just ended up putting together my favorite exercises and fill in the gaps as needed.

Do you think if I just took out lower body and split them up to upper/lower days with the added pullups, RDLs, maybe calfs/abs and all the sets down to 3 focusing more on form/technique and slow eccentric is a good plan for now?",1,0.8891
1kpfmr0,msybugo,fycROMAN,2025-05-18 13:44:47,"Yeah I lower the weight 5-10lbs per set so I'm doing more then 6 reps and since it's free form dumbbells, I only go as close to failure I feel safe doing as a beginner which feels really good when I'm lowering the weight now that my joints are getting stronger. Do you do basically only dumbbell exercises in your routines?

I rest about 2 minutes between sets and I used to do 2-3 sets per exercise and run the routine twice but I found this routine shaved off like an hour. And I rarely feel sore the next day so that being said, how do I lower the amount of sets? Less rest? Less volume decreases? It's probably just bad technique like really slowing down on the eccentric and getting better ROM which I will now work on because you're right, I'm doing way too many sets. They should be more like 3 each I'm assuming at most...

Would it even make a difference if I took the lower body workouts to my rest days or something? Or is that still too much volume for my upper body?

I'll give RDL's another shot though, hamstrings are definitely in need of attention, thank you so much for your inputs! You got me thinking for sure <3",1,0.9739

Well guess what? Had to go see a PT yesterday for a shoulder issue, and it turns out my mobility is woefully, laughably bad. She had me try a Turkish get-up, and friends. Friends. That was the world's most pathetic attempt that has ever been seen. I think I looked like a marionette with broken strings controlled by a duck, or something. 

It's funny how one can be damn strong and pretty tight and stiff at the same time. I should have realized.

And the clip was actually closed onto my shirt, so I remove it and see a hole where the clip had closed onto it. So then it clicks, apparently the clip is sharp enough to cut holes in my clothes if they get caught, and that's why they were always in the front waist area. Glad I figured it out but felt so dumb.

1kon46q,msvbdbl,Joe_from_statefarm,2025-05-17 23:04:38,"Six months ago, I was in a dark place. Burnt out from work, drowning in anxiety, and barely holding it together. I didn’t recognize myself in the mirror anymore—not physically, and definitely not mentally. I was skinny-fat, tired all the time, and had lost all sense of purpose.

One day, I snapped. Not in a bad way—more like a screw this, it’s time to take control kind of way.

I started small. I committed to hitting the gym 6 days a week, even if I didn’t feel like it. I stopped treating the gym like a punishment and started treating it like therapy. I also cleaned up my diet—not perfectly, but I cut the crap, started tracking my macros, and made sure I was eating to build, not just survive.

I got on a lean bulk. Watched the scale move, watched the strength go up. I started deadlifting more than my body weight, then squatting, then benching. It became addicting.

But here’s the thing: it wasn’t just the muscle that changed—it was my mindset. Training gave me discipline. Nutrition gave me structure. And the results gave me confidence I hadn’t felt in years.

Now? I’m up 14 pounds, sitting around 13% body fat, and for the first time in my life, people ask me for workout advice. More importantly—I’m proud of myself again.

I’m not done. Not even close. But if you’re where I was—anxious, lost, just going through the motions—this is your sign. Start today. Lift something heavy. Go on a walk. Drink some water. Track your food. Take your life back.

A ton of gym employees were in the parking lot and three cop cars came rolling in. We asked what was going on and the gym manager said that a guy had attempted a robbery nearby, stolen a van, double parked the van and left it running in the parking lot, ran through the gym, hopped into the pool, swam across it, then jumped the fence and kept running through the church next door - all while being armed. The cops asked if we saw anything and we were so embarrassed to admit we didn’t…apparently this dude caused a huge commotion and we were both so focused on our workouts that it went completely over our heads 😭 and our gym isn’t huge so i would think one of us would have noticed but nope!",8,0.2701
1kon46q,msu0ic5,cyclingthroughlife,2025-05-17 18:36:30,"Our gym has a set of 4 squat racks arranged in a 2 by 2 configuration. The racks are arranged where you have two racks side by side, and the other two racks are directly opposite, facing the other two. When all four racks are in use, you can be facing and looking at the person in front of you.

Behind the squat racks are a large bank of mirrors on the wall. I usually pick the racks that face the wall and mirrors so I can monitor my form while doing squats and deadlifts.

So this week, I'm in there doing squats and deadlifts, and as usual, I am on the rack facing the mirrors. Three of the four racks were used, and the only one open was the one facing me.

As I'm starting my deadlifts, this lady I see regularly comes in wearing leggings. She is obviously in great shape and I can tell by the size of her quads and thighs that she does a lot of legwork (she's got bigger thighs than me!). She promptly gets in front of me, blocks my view of the mirror, and then facing the mirror, proceeds to bend down to stretch with her butt facing me.

So here I am, doing ""touch and go"" deadlifts, trying to look at my form in the mirror, and all I can see is her butt in my line of sight. I'm trying to be respectful, so I angle my head upwards and look above the mirrors so I won't be staring at her butt.

Then after my set is done and I'm recovering, I sit down on a plyo box by the rack, while facing the mirror. The lady is now on the floor of the squat rack, laying down flat on the floor to stretch, her body positioned so that her feet is facing me directly. She promptly spreads her legs wide with her crotch right in my line of sight. So now, I have to turn my body 90 degrees to face another direction so I won't be looking directly at her. 

That said, that was an aside to my accomplishment. I had physical therapy on my knee last year and had to limit my weight on squats for quite some time. The physical therapists gave me some exercises to do to strengthen my hips and to increase hip flexibility and mobility. I've been ramping it back up slowly, per their advice. Finally, this week I decided to ramp it up a bit. Given that I haven't squatted 225 lbs in over a year, I was a bit nervous (although I have been squatting 205 the last couple of weeks). I ended up doing 3 sets of 6 at 225, and best of all, with no knee pain.",8,0.8777

Not sure if it’s just not being used to sets of 12-15, a bad week due to stress and bad sleep or the calorie deficit finally starting to bite.

So now trying to decide if I tell my spreadsheet I hit the targets and hope it was just a bad workout or two, let the autoregulation do its thing, or swap them out and use the strength rtf instead. Probably option 2 until the end of week three at least and then option 3 if it’s still a struggle.

Well, we haven't been going consistently, especially lately. Tbh I've always thought from the off that their heart isn't really in it. So last week when we ended up not going, I basically gave them a good dressing down - 'this isn't working is it?' And told them they were more than welcome to go alone that evening if they really wanted to - nope.


They told me they'd cancelled their membership. I haven't. For me this means all systems go. I have now cleaned my diet right up, drinking much more water and am going 5 times a week.


It's such a shame but I realised they were actually bogging me down in a way. And now I feel free. Yes I have gone alone in the past, and even with another friend, but I would feel bad for not going with this friend so stuck out for them and went when I could on the 2 evenings a week they were free.

1knw7h9,msna6sw,smthamazing,2025-05-16 16:06:52,"Hi! I'm a woman in my late 30s, physically very weak. I've been doing resistance bands and other strength workouts for the past few months, and while I like some progress there, I'm curious about the optimal rest duration between reps and sets.

When I'm doing an exercise, my arms or legs often give up after as few as 3 reps on the lightest band I could find. I just physically cannot do more - not because it's painful, but because my muscles just ""stop working"" after a certain point. It takes 2-3 minutes before I can do the next set, and up to 15-20 minutes for full recovery without feeling any discomfort.

However, if I do a set of 3 and then rest for 20-30 minutes, I don't feel any muscle tiredness _at all_. I can do another set, feeling as good as new, but each time my muscles give up after a few reps.

In theory I could literally exercise for the whole day by doing 30-minute rests, but I've never seen this suggested anywhere. All sources seem to recommend a single good workout with relatively short (less than 5 minutes) breaks between sets.

So, is there any point in doing very short sets throughout the day with lots of rest in between? Or do they not bring much value beyond the first one, where I do as many repetitions as I can?

Does anyone else only start sweating *after* your workout is finished? I enjoy all kinds of cardio, primarily running and basketball.

I’ve had coaches in my youth try to run me ragged until I started to sweat because they thought I wasn’t working hard enough. But it just doesn’t happen.

But when I’m finished with the workout, the floodgates open and I start dripping sweat everywhere. This goes on for 20ish minutes or until I start working out again. So I end up not being cool enough during the workout when I need the sweat, and having to wait a long time after I’m finished before I can clean up.

1knw7h9,msmeykk,ganoshler,2025-05-16 13:30:14,"People who can do pistol squats have these things: 

* Strong legs relative to body weight
* good ankle mobility (and the longer your femurs, the more ankle mobility you need) 
* good hip mobility
* sense of balance
* strong stabilizer muscles (adductors, abductors, calves, etc)
* strong hip flexor to hold up the free leg
* hamstring flexibility in the free leg
* not afraid to try and fall over
* practice doing pistol squats or similar movements (it's a learned skill, some people pick it up quicker than others)

Some people luck out and just naturally have most/all of these things without training. Some people have to attack this as a project and work on crossing each one off the list. Sounds like your bf is in the first group and you're in the second. 

So, no, your ability to do a pistol squat doesn't say anything about your progress in strength training. 

Do you *want* to make this a goal? Which of the things on the list do you have? Do you want to work on acquiring the others?",4,0.9861
1knw7h9,msljwn5,whatThisOldThrowAway,2025-05-16 09:48:11,"There's tonnes of reasons for this: 

* It's a non-trivial bodyweight exercise so body composition plays a big factor: Being skinny is a big advantage 

* Quite specific kinds of Mobility - specifically ankle dorsiflexion mobility - can make the totally unsupported / bodyweight variation of the exercise much easier or, more importantly, much more difficult. You could also spoof this if one person was wearing flat shoes and one person happened to be wearing very heel-padded running shoes when you did the test. 

* there's a big balance/co-ordination/skill/proprioception component - and there's many lifestyle things outside the gym that can teach that. 

* It's a unilateral compound exercise - and lots of sports train this - while being a relatively uncommon gym exercise. 

Long story short: If you asked 50 decent soccer players; and 50 decent power-lifters to pistol squat at random - my bet is that more of the runners would be able to do it.",3,0.4349

Could this have been due to the fact it's the first time that I've completed 4 sets of 12 on the Bench Press at 50kg? I've always struggled in the past to hit 10 reps on the bench press with that weight, but today was the first time I managed to complete all sets with 12 reps.

Any suggestions? Is it simply that I'm not eating enough or resting enough between sets?

1kn3k6o,msh2xmh,istasber,2025-05-15 16:34:00,"I'm a good ways into an aggressive weight loss (down to about 20% body fat from around 30% to begin with, started late february), and it's gone so smooth for me compared to previous diets that I feel like I should share what's worked in case it will help other people.

Obviously a successful diet is a personal thing, different things will work better or worse for different people, but the big change I made this time around was to think about diet from a weekly calorie budget instead of a daily one. Days that I go to the gym, I budget in a bunch of sugar before my workout and a big meal afterwards, on days I lounge around at home, I eat very little.

Doing this, I've managed to stick to a pretty regular routine, haven't really needed to adjust calorie intake or eating habits as I lose weight, and haven't suffered from any nasty diet side effects like grumpiness, hunger pains or loss of energy/strength. An added bonus is that I have a couple of back to back near fasting days, and weighing myself at the end of that stretch makes it much easier to track progress. Surprisingly, my body weight varies by 3-4% over the course of the week between the effects of the gym, fiber intake, sodium intake, carb intake, etc, it'd be really easy to lose the around 1% body weight loss I'm achieving per week in that noise if I didn't have that regular weekly reset.",10,0.9124

 For the brands I buy, at least, this gives it a smooth, mousse like consistency that's very pleasant! I even sometimes add a tiny bit of water to get the same effect if the yogurt is a bit thicker than I like.

Also, on a cut, swapping out your normal sized spoon for a teaspoon can be quite fun, makes it feel like you have so much food because it fills up the spoon and takes longer to eat. This possibly only works if you have quite a simple brain, but it works for me lol",20,0.937

If you’re still treating your warm-up like 5 minutes on a treadmill and a few arm circles, you’re missing out.

A good warm-up does more than raise your heart rate—it prepares your joints, muscles, and nervous system to perform.

Try this 4-step warm-up flow before your main lift:

Target a tight area with 30 seconds of foam rolling or a lacrosse ball

Stretch that area with 15–30 seconds of static stretching

Add a dynamic movement for 10–15 reps (e.g., leg swings, band pull-aparts)

Do 2–3 ramp-up sets of your main lift, increasing load and speed each time

Takes 5–7 minutes and drastically improves how you feel under the bar. Less stiffness, better positions, and more confidence when things get heavy.",2,0.9276

**TL;DR:** I am unable to build a home gym due to lack of space so I'm going to bitch in long format.

Almost every machine at the gym I go to is total dogshit. I can list the good ones on one hand. They all have poor strength curves (which I can excuse to some degree, machines ain't cheap) but then they also have esoteric bullshit like a standing single-leg Hamstring curl taking up space, a variety of hotel-style multi-purpose cable machines (which I admittedly do use for bicep curls, but could live without,) while the whole gym only has a total of 2 benches and 2 squat racks. They have 1 fucking elliptical. Absolutely NONE of their machines are bolted down, and I watched someone trip into the Lateral Raise machine and tip it over. You cannot do weighted back extensions because their 90-degree apparatus is not bolted to the floor. *They don't even have a 45-degree one-- that shit costs like $300.*

I mean this in all honesty: If I was as bad at my job as whoever populated this gym with equipment I would be fired **immediately** for gross incompetence. 

The equipment since I started going here has also gotten worse over time. They replaced their perfectly good set of EZ and straight bars with a set that has half as many increments and takes up virtually the same floor space. They replaced some incline benches that had nice wide back pads with some shitty narrow ones that don't even have adjustable seat angles. There has been 2 broken treadmills for literally 4 months now. A bunch of the cable machines have DIY replacement cables that are too long and bottom out the weight stack if I use full ROM, and I'm not particularly tall or flexible. They also re-upholstered a bunch of their machine pads recently, clearly not from the manufacturer, and they are *slippery as fuck*. This gym has less total weight in bumper plates than I can deadlift.

This gym has amenities that a lot of people seem to like, like a (dry) sauna and a pool, but both of those things are honestly *fucking gross* and I can't opt out of paying for them. People bring their young children to use this pool. Why would I want to pay to get Norovirus? Why the fuck should I be forced to subsidize this shit I don't use? Put a fucking scanner on the door to the pool to unlock it and let me opt the fuck out.

They also have at least 4 or more people working at the gym at all times. These people are mostly 'working' at the desk and providing **absolutely no value** to members unless they want to fork over like $15 for a protein shake. This is in the middle of the day which is when, I assume, there are less people than the after work rush. I don't even want to comment on how bad their personal trainers are beyond saying one of them pushed a client I know into getting a real injury (fractured leg) under their supervision, and that person's workout routine they got from them is *absolutely awful* at accomplishing the goal they're going to the gym for.

Now here's the kicker: These fuckers charge me like $50/mo for this shit. I have the most barebones membership possible, which only allows me to use 2 gyms in the franchise, one of which is NOT the one in the most populous local city than most people commute to, but one about 35 minutes away in the other direction. For reference, I used to go to 2 different Crunch gyms on my commute that were both better maintained, and had more equipment than this gym for $15/mo (it would have been $10/mo, but I paid the extra $5 to attend *any* Crunch across North America.) There are no other gyms within a ~25 minute drive (I WFH, so no commute anymore.) It would cost me more in gas and time to go to any other gym. I have absolutely no interest or financial ability to start up a local competitor, but I have gone to a local council meeting to propose they should build a community owned option.

1. Dumbbell Bicep Curls; My left arm feels something weird when doing these. Its as if I have a tendon or vein that's in the way, and it gets pushed around when I do the curls. Not hugely painful, but uncomfortable and it feels like I might pull something if I push too hard. The feeling is at the bottom right (of my left forearm). Is this something that's common? What should I do? (Hammer curls feel much better. Right arm is fine with both. Left arm isn't weaker, I can still do about the same amount of reps.)
2. Dumbbell Lateral Raise: My shoulders crack/pop a bit when doing this. I pushed myself once and got a huge stiff neck right after. So I've been taking it easy with this.

Just curious if these kinds of things are common and what the workarounds are. Maybe its simple and I'm just not warming up enough, or maybe I should just avoid these trainings or whatever.",1,0.94

**A bit about my structure:**  
Currently, I’m working out 2–4 times a week using an upper/lower body split. I follow four different workouts that share the same overall structure and format. My primary focus is hypertrophy, so I aim for 10 reps per exercise, maintaining consistent weight across all sets. I prioritize compound movements, although some exercises—such as the barbell bench press and deadlift—are intentionally excluded due to health concerns and logistical limitations. I try to hit each muscle group twice a week and I try to keep each workout under one hour as a compromise between duration and effectiveness. I'm aware that slightly increasing volume might be beneficial. Additionally, I do cardio twice a week: one session targets heart rate zones 2–3 (steady-state), and the other focuses on high-intensity intervals in zones 4–5.

I'm a 325lb 6'3"" guy. 

I'm on week four of the table and I'm trying to decide if I should do week three over again because I having trouble keeping going for the last part. I screwed up my schedule last week and ended up just working out Tuesday and Thursday instead of my normal MWF routine. 

While on the elliptical my BPM is going up past 160 before I start ""walking"" again to lower it. My jogging speed tends to be \~6MPH starting out and towards the end, I'm around 4.75. The ""Walking"" pace is usually 2.5 to 3.5MPH. 

**Are those speeds too fast?**  *I know they're not ""too slow"" because I'm jumping up to 150 BPM in less than 90 seconds.* 

I'm getting told by my untrained father that I shouldn't be doing elliptical because I'm cheating myself. My dad tends to act like he's an expert on everything I'm willing to admit I'm ignorant about so I can't rely on this being good information. **Should I be on a bike or treadmill instead of the elliptical?** 

When working out, **sometimes my hands go numb like they're going to sleep. Am I hurting myself?**

1kkm7ss,mrwe6wj,whatThisOldThrowAway,2025-05-12 12:01:05,"Question about range of motion and angles in the hip thurst: 

My gym has one of these bad boys: [image](https://images.activefitnessstore.com/product-large/BB-STN-2-0/booty-builder-station-2.0-bb-stn-2-0.jpg?_gl=1*1qob7my*_gcl_au*ODExNjA1NzUzLjE3NDcwNTA1NTE.) 

The one in my gym is slightly different (possibly an older model) but also by bootybuilder. It's a fixed, angled pad bolted into the ground so you can do hip thursts, pretty standard. 

Except, it's got (A) very high back-pad (B) very high 'safeties' on the side. This means, if you just do regular hip-thursts with your feet planted on the ground, the range of motion is super small, because the bar starts high up (especially for someone short like me). It's like doing ""pin hip thursts""... which is not an exercise I've ever heard of, probably for a reason. 

So the station also has (C) an angled-foot-platform pretty high off the ground, that you can adjust closer or farther to the pad. 

Combo of A+B+C, from my experimentation, leads to a hip thrust that looks goofy as all hell, but has a super long range of motion, and hits the glutes (on me personally) instantly. We all know how pernickety and individual foot placement can be in the hip thurst, but on this thing it doesn't seem to matter, it's all ass. 

I'm also loading up a fraction of the weight and it feels tough: I throw on 1PL instead of 2+ and the exercise seems harder.... but in my head it's the same exercise but lifted up a bit, and a little more horizontal maybe? 


**Question for anyone who has used these**

* Do you find (for whatever reason) it's more glute focused regardless? 

* Any explanation as to why it's *so* much harder? The mechanics seem similar but it feels like a new exercise. I get the bar's moving farther, but not like... *that* much farther.",1,0.9664

Details are as follows:

Me, I'm a 39, 150lb, 5'7.

Day 1 - 6-7 mile run w/ 550 ft elevation.  Pact around 9:30-10:30  
Day 2 - Bit of a struggle upper body day

* Bench free weights 7 set of 6 reps @ 105lbs. Down from my previous week of 6x7 @ 110
* Pull-ups 5 set of 3 reps. Down from my previous week of 5x4 + negatives for one round
* Row machine 6set of 9 reps @ 100lbs. Up from previous week from 90lbs
* Overhead dumbbell press. 5 set of 7 rep @ 40lb. Standard
* Body-weight dip 5 set of 10. Standard
* Hanging knee raise 5 set of 12. Standard
* Cable wood chop 5 set of 7 @ 20lbs. Up from 15lbs

Day 3 - 35 mins on the elliptical. My ankle was tight so I didn't run.  
Day 4 - Lower body

* Warm up of bar + 95lb squats for two rounds
* Squat free 5 set of 7 reps @ 150lbs. Up from previous week, which I think was 140.
* Trap bar dead lift. 6 set of 3 reps.  Tried to increase but ended up going so did two sets at 165, then dropped to 155.
* Kettlebell swing 5 set of 15 reps @ 40lbs. That is the highest kettlebell I got
* Smith machine barbell lunge. I'm still confused at the bar weight according to the sticky on that smith machine. So I'm either 20lbs heavier than I think I am or something. Anyway. 5 sets of 8 reps @ 65 lbs.
* Dumbbell bench hip thrust. 5 sets of 10 @ 55lbs. Standard
* Hanging knee raises 5 set of 12. Standard.
* Treadmill walk 15 mins at highest incline 2mph

Day 5 - 3.11 mile 10 pace 150ft

Day 6 - is always all over the place. Sometimes it is a short run, light yoga, swim, a full body circuit (squat, deadlift, bench + row, core). Last week I didn't do anything.

I dont have large rear delts, it basically feels like I have no rear delts and when I try to get in low bar position is just hurts cuz the bar is touching bone and also quite low feeling because there isnt a cushion rear delts to hold it.

Should I try to grow my rear delts more to help provide more cushion and support for my low bar squat? Or am I just doing something wrong? In my program I have side delt (lateral raises) and front delt (OHP) but I dont really have rear delt exercises. Are those exercises enough to grow rear delt?

Step one:  Ignore all data from any wearable technology or smart scale.  There is nothing on the market that is close to accurate at estimating calories or TDEE.  You may as well spin a wheel or pull a number out of a hat.  There is a reason researchers use metabolic wards and doubly labeled water when trying to track calorie usage, there is not another reliable way.

Step two: track every calorie you eat, weigh and measure, not guess, and track your weight every morning.  Do this for two weeks, taking your weekly average, and this should get you an idea of your true TDEE based on changes in weight.  Use this number and continue this practice for another 2-4 weeks to dial it in.  It will never be perfect, but it will be as close as you can get.",4,0.5879

Among other exercises, I've been squatting and deadlifting, as I know they're great compound exercises. However, I've been feeling lower back pain after leg days and today I hurt lower back trying to deadlift 70kg (lol) despite managing that weight okay-ish a week earlier. So I've decided I need to work on my mobility before coming back to squatting and deadlifting.

As such, I've replaced my Lower A and Lower B days with the following:

**Lower A:-**
- Romanian Deadlift,
- Step ups,
- Bulgarian split squat,
- Seated calf raise,
- Goblet squats

**Lower B:-**
- Hip thrusts,
- Lying leg curl,
- Leg press,
- Goblet squats

Does anyone know if these will be good for fixing my hip and ankle mobility to later progress back to deadlifts and squats safely? I heard that targeted resistance training is better than stretching for mobility and gets faster results, but a hundred people will tell you a hundred different things regarding exercise so I need a sanity check.

Background:  
Male, 31  
Height: 181 cm  
Weight: 88 kg  
Body fat: \~20% (goal is 15%)  
Fat-Free Mass: \~71 kg  
Skeletal Muscle Mass: \~40-41 kg (from InBody)  
Caloric intake: \~2000 kcal/day  
Protein intake: 120-130g/day

My most consistent period of gym training was 5 years ago - about 2 years straight. About a year ago I also trained for \~3 months. So while I’m essentially starting over, I do have good lifting technique and experience with machines, barbells, and dumbbells.

Current constraints:  
No access to a gym right now, so I'm using adjustable dumbbells only - they go up in steps: 6.5, 11, 15.5, 20, and 24.5 kg.

I train every other day and my main goal is body recomposition - reduce body fat to 15% and add 2–4 kg of lean mass if possible.

Workout plan (Full Body, all in supersets):

1. Squat + Standing shoulder press
2. Romanian deadlift + Overhead triceps extension
3. Two-arm dumbbell row + Dumbbell chest press
4. Lying dumbbell pullover (for lats) + Biceps curl

Progression plan:

\- Weeks 1-4: 6.5 kg, 8 reps, 3 sets for all exercises, adding +1 rep per week  
\- Weeks 5-8+: Progress by increasing reps for weaker exercises or moving up to 11 kg and resetting reps to 8  
\- Continue progression through the available weight levels using the same approach",2,-0.7579

What kind of program are you following? Follow a structured hypertrophy program if you're not already (you can find some in the wiki!) or just stick with what you're doing since a couple months isn't really that long. Obviously you know your body best, but consider eating a bit more, maybe just by slowly adding more calories, continuing that focus on protein. 1300-1350 seems low to be building muscle on, even for your size, considering you're reasonably active. Even though you've gained a couple pounds since starting, I'd venture to guess a bit of that is water weight. Follow your experience, though, it's tough to gauge someone else's needs.

If you want to build more muscle, you may want to consider bulking at some point. If you're just getting serious about gains, you can probably make plenty of progress just following a program and eating around maintenance for awhile, though.",3,0.9286

1. Reaching a point where it is hard to progress, since it is more difficult to add resistance.
2. I have a bit of a problem with forward/rounded shoulders, and I've been attempting to mitigate this with back workouts, but I'm unsure how much back is trained with bodyweight/calisthenics.

I have a home gym in my garage consisting of a power tower, weight belt with plates, a simple bench (no rack), and two adjustable dumbbells that go up to 45kg each.


My home office that I work from is an extension of my garage, so super convenient. However, I'm fairly time-poor (intense job and a young - and growing - family).


I do the following exercises 3 sets each, 3 days per week (Mon/Wed/Fri) - weights are total, either belts, or 1 or 2 dumbbells, or combined):
- Dead hang pull-ups (5kg, 8/7/6)
- Dead hang chin-ups (5kg, 8/7/6)
- Weighted Calf Raises (75kg, 12/11/10)
- Goblet squats (50kg, 12/11/10)
- Bulgarian Split Squats (50kg, 9/8/7)
- Dumbbell rows (36kg, 9/8/7)
- Planks with dumbbell pull through (36kg, 10/8/8)
- Russian twists with dumbbell (36kg, 10/8/8)
- Seated dumbbell shoulder press (36kg, 8/7/6)
- Dumbbell flys (36kg, 8/7/6)
- Dumbbell lateral raises (30kg, 8/7/6)
- Full crunch leg raises (25kg, 10/9/8)
- Full crunch knee raises (25kg, 10/9/8)
- Weighted dips (25kg, 10/9/8)
- Weighted press-ups (25kg, 10/9/8)


The bit that is a bit strange is, because I'm poor on time, I've gotten into the habit of ripping through one set of each of these all in a row (so starting with pull-ups, ending with press-ups, with basically no breaks). I do this a total of three times, spaced out throughout the day. Takes me typically between 15-20 minutes each ""superset"".


I suspect that I won't be getting as much out of the later exercises as if I were taking proper breaks, but does anyone see any other downsides with this approach? Should I maybe change it up and try to focus on muscle groups? Does anyone else do anything like this? (I've searched a fair bit but haven't found anything quite like this, but maybe I just don't know what I'm searching for)


I'm also not typically going to failure, but stopping well before. I'm kind of paranoid about avoiding injury, esp. with the other demands in my life. Does this severely limit potential benefits, or not really?


Been doing this for about a year now, but have noticed I'm not really progressing much anymore, very rarely bumping weights up for instance. I'm feeling pretty fit and lean but keen to get to that ""borderline ripped"" physique, but not sure that'll happen on this trajectory.",1,-0.7138

1kfzurr,mqxacp7,PocketFred,2025-05-06 18:00:20,"Hi,

I've been going to the gym regularily for the past two years now, although initially only followed various types of courses (Mils Body Pump, Spinning etc.. which I believed helped with my form). For the past 6-8 months I've gained a real liking to ""plain"" weight lifting and started the 5/3/1 for beginners workout routine (Squats, BP, DL, OHP + whatever assistance I feel like) around Feb/March to better structure my workouts. I workout in the gym 3x/week at least, sometimes i manage 4-5.

About me: 37M, 95kg / 193cm (I've actually gained a little wheight since starting the 5/3/1, however, my body has definitely changed for the better and I'll put some of the extra weight down to starting creatine supplementation). I have a desk job but I cycle to/from work 4x/week (1h/day) and am physically active outside on weekends. Body type now is the ""goes to the gym but nevers says no to cookies"" kind althgouh I have heavily cut back on snacks. I don't think I drink significantly (2 beers on weekends on average with the occasional more festive evening maybe 1x/month at max). I do realize that I would see great results if I was able to fully master my diet and get my body fat down, but I'm not there just yet...

My goals: not sure, I guess getting fitter and stronger. I'm already super stoked to have safely reached 1:1 ratio for squats & DLs. 100kgs is just around the corner and I suppose I'll just see where the journey takes me.

Here are my current stats:

||
||
||Squat|Bench|Deadlift|Press|
|1RM|110|75|110|45|
|TM|100|67.5|100|40|
|Max reps 95%|12x95|15\*60|15\*95|10\*37.5|
|Calculated E1RM|133|90|142|50|

As you can see my rep count is on the higher side (except for OHP) and I'm keeping a little distance from the theoretical E1RMs just to feel ""safe"". I will mostly do 5 reps even if the routine says 3 on the work up to the 95% set and on the final 5x5 of the exercies I'll usually do 15/10 or 10/10/5 to keep my muscles more under tention.

Now my question is: should I make more use of the ""calculated E1RM"" and adjust the table accordingly in order to reduce my reps and stick to the 5x5 ?

Ex: for the next cycle, I go: 1RM Squat: 130, Bench: 90, DL: 140, Press: 50 ?

Looking forward to your input!

Cheers!",1,0.9914

I am a climber who lived in Boulder CO but now lives in Denver CO.

For my compound lifts, the ones that are above 1 set I usually hit failure on second and third set at reps 4-3. I would also like to note that I move between reps as a way of progressing, so for example pec fly when I go up in weight I’ll go to 8 reps, then 9 or 10, etc until 12, so usually whatever the reps say right now is somewhere in a range that I move between.

Im trying to be fit and healthy, but also maintain my weight. I've made myself a at home working out schedule which includes jumping rope and body weight exercises (plank, push ups, mountain climbers, etc). I'm just trying to burn as much as I can without overdoing it.

I could take some walks outside but I get bored easily. I know this is not a good excuse buuut I have really sensitive ears so l can't use headphones etc to listen to music or podcasts.

I'm thinking of buying a stepper machine (the really small ones) to increase my daily steps because they're a lot cheaper than walking pads and better for storage. Otherwise I'll just resort to a walking pad.

I would like some advice for my bodybuilding program. I've used Jeff Nippard's 45 minutes program 3x a week and adapted it to last around 1 hour. I'm 32yo, lifted at home with some basic equipment for 1,5 year (not huge progress, I was discovering) and recently moved out and a cool gym opened so I'm using this program at gym for 2,5 months now
I'm using MYOREPS and dropsets to win some times on my isolation movements
My rep range might look big, but it depends on my weight progression, I try to reach around 12-15 reps before getting the weight up and then go back to 8-12

Day 1 Lower :
- Ham Curl 3 x 8-15
- Hack Squat 3 x 6-10
- Leg Press 3 x 6-12
- Leg extension 3 x 8-15
- Standing calves raises 2 x 8-15 reps + MYOREPS 
- Inclined Curl 2 x 8-15 + MYOREPS 
- DB lat raises 2 x 8-15 + MYOREPS
- BB skull crusher 2 x 8-15 + MYOREPS

Day 2 Upper : 
- Inclined DB bench press 1 ""heavy set"" 5-12 reps and 2 lighter set 8-12 reps
- DB chest fly 3 x 8-15
- Cable Lat pull down 1 ""heavy set"" 5-12 reps and 1 lighter set 8-12 reps
- Cable Rows 3 x 8-15
- Cable Facepull 2 x 8-15 Dropsets 
- Cabl Triceps Ext. 2 x 8-15 Dropsets
- Machine Biceps Curl 2 x 8-15 Dropsets


Day 3 Fullbody :
- Inclined DB bench press 1 ""heavy set"" 5-12 reps and 1 lighter set 8-12 reps
- Cable Lat Prayer 2 set 8-15 reps (depends on my actual weight)
- RDL 3 x 8-12
- Squat 1 ""heavy set"" 5-8 reps and 1 lighter set 8-12 reps
- BB skull crusher 2 x 8-15 + MYOREPS 
- Inclined Curl 2 x 8-15 + MYOREPS 
- DB lat raises 2 x 8-15 + MYOREPS 
- Standing calves raise 2 x 8-15 + MYOREPS

If you can't do dips, do more chest strength first. Bench press, chest fly, pushups etc.



Having the bars closer together will make it slightly easier but will require better shoulder mobility. Focus on keeping your shoulder blades down and together.

Or you can use a resistance band for assistance. You can also do bench dips -- it's a slightly different motion because your arms are behind you, but it could help.

Wider dips tend to hit the chest more. If you only have one dip station and it feels wide to you, then you'll have to use that one. The difference won't be critical -- maybe you won't be able to get as many reps but you'll be able to do some and you'll get similar benefits.",1,0.9397

A: I'm doing heavy squats and hear some weird squeaky noises. Rack my weights and look around. Some really scrawny kid was in the Smith machine and had decided that ""if you can bench 400 you are strong"" means your very first day you slap every plate on. He managed to unrack it and it dropped on his chest, so he couldn't breath, just squeak. Pulled everything off and got him up. He was ok but shaking like a leaf and told me what he was doing. He eventually left and I never saw him again.

B: I was doing a warm up on an elliptical machine and the guy next to me had was grunting like mad and had a huge puddle (l mean like half a gallon of sweat ) on the floor. I look at his settings -- everything was at max. He was pudgy and (it turned out) an engineering student from India. He'd looked up the specs on the machine and realized that if he ran 2 back to back (90 min. Total) sessions, he could loose 1/2 kilo (1+ lb) a workout. Ergo, all he had to do was workout once or twice a week. Mind you, this was day 1, he obviously had lived a sedentary life and looked seriously like he was going to code..Me being STEM faculty meant I could chat him up and talked him into just ending his first session after 15 or 20 minutes, to ""ease"" into it.

I slept like absolute garbage this past week, so last night I popped a melatonin before bed - shoutout to Thorne - and slept wonderfully. You'd think that would set me up nicely for my lower power session this morning, right? 

Nope. Worst I've had in months.

Started with barbell squats (225), but something felt a off during my warmup set. Both physically and mentally. Got through my three sets, but I didn't like how they felt and my mindset was circling the drain.

Moved onto deadlifts (315). Again, warmup set felt weird. Mindset got worse. Loaded the bar, went to do my first rep, and barely got the bar off the ground. Said in my head ""nope, not today."" May have flung my belt against the wall in frustation.

Didn't want to chance it with any other sets. Not while in such a bad state of mind. So I half-assed my planks and called it a day. Was NOT happy.

Like I said, I was WAY overdue for a bad workout, so I should consider myself fortunate in that regard. But I turn 42 later this year, and I know in the long run my physical abilities will deteriorate.

For reference I am 5’2” 130lb F, and my bench PR/top weight has been stuck at 1-3 reps of 135 for the past year. I know advancing past this 135lb point is going to be tough, but A WHOLE YEAR?! i’m very consistent with my lifts and routine, I will keep one routine for roughly 4-5 months when my lifts start to feel like they plateau. Currently, I’ve been rocking incline barbell bench, flat bench machine (to really cook past failure), and cable flys (with an upward angle). All exercises I do 3 sets of generally 6-10, with my last set (and sometimes the second set) being until failure. All my movements are done slow and controlled to support overall time under tension and alllll that good stuff :)

I have spent A LOT of time improving and making minor tweaks to form, and feel confident my form is not what’s holding me back from increasing my bench.

Bench, OHP, Pull-ups, Rows, Tricep Pushdown, Lateral Raises, Curls. Then BSS, RDL, Leg extension, Leg curl. Abs both days.

Given these exercises, is it better to:

1) Swap to a more fullbody, say BSS, Bench, Pull-ups on one day, RDL, OHP, Rows another day.

2) If so, or even sticking to U/L split, does it make sense to do isolations unrelated to compounds?

For example, let's say I do BSS, Bench, Pull-ups. Should I do leg extensions after, and then no quad work on the next workout (doing RDLs and leg curls), or swap extensions and curls so I'm hitting quads/hamstrings 3x/week, and each movement is fresher rather than impacted by the compound lift of that day? 

My reasoning for both questions is that it seems somewhat redundant to do overlapping work on the same day, and then wasteful to not do them the next session when fully recovered, compared to giving a big stimulus 3x/week.

Been thinking about getting a DEXA scan as a baseline point for match body fat calipers to. 

One question that came up was whether or not hydration state might render this less useful than initially thought, and it turns out there's some research on this topic:

> Training regimens that typically induce dehydration and nutrition regimens that involve carbohydrate loading can result in apparent changes to LTM measurement by DXA. 

HOWEVER:

> No change in total fat mass or bone mineral content was observed at any timepoint.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28204901/

Likewise:

> Results indicate that acute water ingestion before a DXA analysis will significantly influence body composition. More precisely, acute ingestion of 500 ml of water will **significantly inflate fat free mass as well as lower percent body fat**.

but

> There were no significant changes in fat mass (−10.6 ± 493.4g).

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261561420301552

Now I still don't want to be a full on 110kg  bodybuilder. Just looking for a aesthetic build. Consuming around 2600 callories to  maintain the muscles and weight. I really don't want to go lower than 80kgs. Keeping it up to eventually get around 10-12% without really cutting at the moment. It will take a while but Well i got my entire life left. 

At the moment my training regiment is 
- gym 4x per week
- 10 km run 1 x per week 
- basketball 1 x per week

Thanks for reading this. Would love to hear your thoughts and any recomendations!",1,0.9385

For some reason, I decided to record myself to see how my form was and oh boy... turns out I never realized I didn't do the full ROM. Squats, supine chest press, dips, rows and lat pulldowns... all are like three quarter instead of a full rep. Unsurprisingly, only the OHP is good ROM since I see myself doing them.

Started doing the full range now and shit man this was sobering. I had to lower the weight everywhere. And I'm not talking about lowering it a kilo or two. I had to lower my supine chest press from 80 kilo to 70. My dips used to be with 9 kilo extra weight, I had to ditch the weight altogether. 

Worst part is that it wasn't even due to ego lifting. I genuinely never realized my ROM wasn't complete and for squats I even had to put my heels on some plates to raise them because otherwise my shitty mobility wouldn't allow me to go deep enough to do a full rep.

And now I'm sore all over the place.

I'm finding it intimidating to move into the phase of heavier weights, I worry about injuring myself and just generally feel not ready to move out of the 8-12 rep range.

I am completely new to weightlifting or anything like that. I don't have access to a gym, and only have 2 25lb (11kg) dumbbells, a pull-up bar, and a piano bench with some cinder blocks. I plan on keeping around the same size, but prioritize hypertrophy, over pure strength. I would say I'm of decent strength, but definitely beginner level.

*45/90 min workout
*medium level

Chest: chest press, incline and decline pushups, flyes
Tricep: overhead triceps extensions/bent over triceps extensions, skull crushers

This is a really tasty recipe i'm going to give you some updates on it you do not have to brown the beef in a separate skillet you can just throw it all into the same pot boil it for 8 minutes and let it simmer for 15 minutes after that

If you're on a serious grind and you need ready meals this is a great great way to go for instance I have been eating this twice a day and I continue to eat it twice a day for two complete meals the whole meal takes about 10 minutes to eat if you chew well so it's extremely efficient

You're gonna end up with a big pot of food if you have a giant tupperware you can store it in that in the fridge or you can just store it in the pot in the fridge

You can add different things my most recent cook off of the ground beef po boy I added some organic basil that I just bought off the shelf, just rinsed and chopped up and threw in there balanced the flavor very well. Extra carrots go great too.

When you reheat the dish you're going to need two dishes one where is the bowl and you scoop two or three ladles into the bowl and heat it up for about 2 1/2 minutes on high power then prepare your hoagie roll And a slice of cheese on another plate and pour the heated up ground beef poboy onto the hoagie roll

Spending a lot of time on the computer, especially while developing [Virten](https://virten.app) and its products, has been a bit like a stress test, or a marathon, for my back muscles. Among other things.

And I don't want to suffer any long-term pains, the sore backs, the curling posture, and all of that stuff that comes with using the computer too much without paying attention to the rest of one's body.

So, since the start up is starting to take shape, and there's plenty more work to do, I figure I myself should get into shape.

Instead of rushing out to the gym I decided to put another important building block in place: Food.

Starbucks sandwiches and an occasional Jersey Mikes sub (tuna salad or philly cheese steak!) has been a good time but the price is too high for me, and that means I can't eat as much food as I need to be healthy.

On the other hand, I don't have time to cook each day.

My solution so far? Cook a large amount of food and eat it over time. This is a good strategy for many people. Particularly those on a household budget and for young men. Infact learned the original form of the recipe this entry is titled for at a bodybuilding blog.

This recipe is really tasty, goes down easily, and provides somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 calories, 25 grams of protein, as well as carbohydrates, fibers, and is generally a healthy food. I think the Ground Bee Po' Boy Red is better on bread, but can be served over pasta or eaten as a chili.

I’ve been tinkering with my recipe for some time now and I’m very happy with where it currently is, so I figured I’d share it here:

* 2 lbs 95% lean ground beef
* 1 medium onion
* 2 10 oz. cans Rotel diced tomatoes and green chiles 
* 10 oz (1 can’s worth) water
* 1 15 oz cans tomato sauce
* 1 can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
* 3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, de-veined, de-seeded, and minced
* 3 cloves of garlic, minced
* 4 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 2 tbsp chili powder
* 2 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1/2 tsp red chili flakes
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp black pepper

In a large pot or 12” Dutch oven, brown the ground beef over medium high heat. As the meat begins to brown, stir in the onions and garlic. Continue cooking until the meat has fully browned and onions are tender. If there is a lot of excess grease, drain.

Stir in the Rotel, water, tomato sauce, beans, chipotle peppers, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir in the seasonings. Adjust to taste.

Cover and cook over medium-high heat until it reaches a boil. Boil a couple minutes, reduce heat, and simmer for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Makes 4 portions that you can serve immediately or store in sturdy freezer bags and freeze. To reheat, place bag in room temp or cool water to thaw, then microwave contents of the bag in a bowl for around 2-3 minutes.

1 serving with this recipe comes to 493 kcal and 58 g. protein. With a couple spoonfuls of light sour cream and about 1/4 cup of grated Colby jack cheese, it comes to 623 kcal and 67 g. protein. I used nonfat unflavored Greek yogurt instead of sour cream once to empty my fridge and it turned out pretty well too, and my girlfriend turned me on to adding a handful of Fritos on top.

Switching from 80% lean to 95% lean ground beef saves around 200 calories but loses a lot of the flavor, so I adjusted with the Worcestershire sauce and leaned heavily on spice. This recipe is a work in progress, so if you have any suggestions I’m open to them.",1,0.8651

I just put them in containers and freeze em, usually takes like 5 minutes in the microwave to reheat and I just eat it straight from the container or add it to a wrap, instant noodles bowl, etc. This recipe is directly from his Instagram (With some personal tweaks): 

Ingredients:

48oz boneless skinless chicken thighs (I usually use 36oz of Chicken Breast, 12oz Chicken Thighs) 

BLEND:

240ml orange juice (I omit this, usually find its too watery)

One 7oz can of chipotle peppers

3 tblspns soy sauce

2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

2 tablespoons garlic purée

2 tsp cumin

1 tablespoon salt

1.5 tsp black pepper

2 tsp onion

80g honey (4 tablespoons)

15g avocado oil (1 tablespoon)

Handful of Cilantro stems

Chicken in slow cooker, blend marinade and pour ontop, mix around, then turn it on. 

Slow Cooker on HIGH for 2-3 hours or LOW for 3-4 hours. Once near done, shred chicken with two forks (Or whatever else you want to use) and put it back for another 30 minutes. If it's too watery (Sometimes it is for me), I use cornstarch+water to thicken the sauce. 

It's just so easy. Blend some ingredients, throw everything in the slow cooker, take 3-4 minutes to shred the chicken, wait a bit for sauce to thicken if needed, then throw it into containers and into the freezer. Been on this for almost 8 months now.",1,0.6713

Large Batch

Tools:

Standard kitchen tools

Large Skillet

Big Soup Pot

Ingredients:

2 lb 85/15 Ground Beef

2 28oz cans of tomato puree or tomato soup (non-bpa lining)

1 Head Red Cabbage

2 Large Red Onions

1 Very Large or 2 Large Orange Carrots

1 lb Block of Cheddar

12 Hoagie Rolls, Cuban Roll, etc

8 Pieces of Garlic

4 tbsp Red Pepper Flakes (mild)

5 tbsp Coarse Sea Salt

2 tbsp Black Pepper

2 tbsp of olive oil



Preparation:



Leave the block of cheddar cheese in the fridge.

Review the preparation recipes below and decide what order you would like to do things in. For myself, I started working the vegetables and about mid-way through the vegetables, I put the Big Soup Pot on the stove and browned the beef.

This recipe takes me about 1 hour and 30 minutes from start to finish with a cleaned-up kitchen (cutting board station, etc.).

You may prefer to do all of the vegetable preparation and then do the next steps. Then you can expect the recipe to take about 2 hours and 15 minutes from start to finish.",1,-0.5423

Prepare the Vegetables....



Chop the red cabbage until it is mostly in roughly quarter-inch wide pieces longer than they are wide.

Slice and dice the red onions into pieces about an inch long.

Shred the carrot(s) lengthwise, then chop into roughly one inch long pieces.

Dice the garlic quite thoroughly, preferably with the famous plunging slice'ndice chef's implement.

Prepare the Beef.........



Brown the beef in a large skillet on medium-high.

Drain out the fat, possibly by scooping the beef from the skillet into the Big Pot with a spatula that has draining holes.

Cooking:



Lightly cover the bottom of the Big Soup Pot with the olive oil so stuff is less likely to stick and burn on the bottom.

Now, everything that isn't bread or cheddar cheese goes into the Big Soup Pot.

All of the vegetables, the beef, the Salt, Pepper, and Red Pepper.

Also add both of the 28oz cans of Tomato Puree/Soup, and about 2/3rds of a 28oz can worth fresh water.

Cover the Big Soup Pot, put the stove on high, and open it up to stir every minute or two.

You'll want to regularly scrape the bottom of the pot so the food nearest the heating element doesn't burn.

Once the Ground Beef Po' Boy concoction is boiling, continue to occasionally stir it.

Let boil for 8-10 minutes. Then reduce heat to Low, give the bottom of the pot a good scraping, cover and let cook for 15 minutes.

Then remove The Big Soup Pot from the heating element.



Alright, all done!

Get yourself a wide bowl to set your hoagie roll in.

Open up the hoagie roll so it has room for the goods.

Add a large slice of cheddar lengthwise along the inside of the hoagie roll (a quarter inch by one inch by 6 inch slice off of the brick of cheese is great).

Fill up the hoagie roll with a large ladle of the Ground Beef Po' Boy concoction.

Add salt and pepper to taste.



Its great!



Comments:



If the concoction has a bit too much water in it, leaving the hoagie roll too wet. Use a ladle or scoop with drain holes to solve.

I tend to add some salt and fresh cracked pepper at meal time.



Heats up great in the microwave. Add the Ground Beef concoction to the hoagie roll after heating.

This is a pretty hearty meal although it goes down pretty easily. Maybe around 600 calories and 30 grams of protein per hoagie. I learned a slightly different version of this recipe from a 2014 bodybuilding blog.



If you have another pot to cook with meanwhile, just toss the covered Big Soup Pot in the refrigerator. Lasts all week.

Afterwards my wife starts talking about how surprised she was and how she had ""preconceptions about what kind of people would have a home gym, with big weights like that.""

She's been doing this for years. First, when her friends hit a certain age and started going to the gym, it was, ""Gosh, I had such assumptions about people who go to the gym, I guess I need to rethink that."" ""Jesse told me she's going to the gym twice a week. She's so smart, I never thought of her as someone that invested in her appearance."" When she found out some of her friends did gym classes that involved weights, it was, ""I never thought someone like her would do a strength class. She's not, like, a meathead."" Her doctor started talking to her about bone density, same thing, ""Gosh, I'm so surprised a doctor would ask me if I'm lifting weights."" 

For context, we've been married for 7+ years, and I owned a barbell when I met her. Not only that, she actually works out with a trainer with me, and of course the trainer has her lifting weights.

1k88nzd,mp9h0bd,arrangementscanbemad,2025-04-27 04:22:16,"Are there any rough ballpark estimates as to the expected muscle to fat gain ratio at different levels of energy surplus? I am not looking for anything too accurate as I know it is dependent on individual factors such as training age, quality of stimulus and a host of genetic factors, but simply a heuristic to make an expected guess as to how long a given amount of fat cut would take to re-accumulate over a bulk.

Some estimated ranges like 70-80% muscle 20-30% fat for +5-10% surplus, 40-60 for +15-20 etc (purely examples). If even such broad ballparks are not useful due to variation resulting from individual circumstances, then I guess knowing that would help, too. 

If it helps to give me a more personal estimate, I'm nearing 2 years in training age (or 1½ only accounting for time not in a deficit), and I'm planning on resuming a 'lean' bulk of around +5-7% caloric surplus (roughly 0.5 to 0.7kg or 0.6 to 0.8% bw/month).

After a life of being very active but not really working out, I'm starting out doing upper body push/pull resistance training about three times a week. Usually three sets to failure or near-failure of four pulling exercises (wide grip pullups, neutral grip pullups, dumbell raises, lateral raises) and three pushing exercises (diamond pushups, dips, seated overhead dumbell presses). I have two main questions:

1. What's a good pushing exercise to add, preferably bodyweight?

2. I'm going to start doing core work and cardio either on off days or 4-6 hours before or after my main session. If these workouts involve some decently taxing strength movements themselves (i.e., pushups for burpees, dead hangs for leg raises), will that mess up my progress in my main workouts?

My thoughts:

You are in year 2 to 3 of your lifting journey. You can expect between 3 and 5 kg of lean muscle gain per year, so that's between 250g and 420g of muscle per month. Everything in excess of 420g bodyweight gain per months will be fat. It's simple as that.   

You plan to bulk with 0.5 to 0.7kg weight gain per week, in your optimal case (420g muscle / 0.5kg weight) you only gain 80g fat per month. In your not so optimal case (250g / 0.7kg) you would gain 460g fat per month.

Althogether still quite lean. Doing it for full 10 months would gain you only 4.8 kg of fat",3,0.9825

Before that, I’d been going to several other gyms over the years — one for a bit over two years, and the rest for a few months or with day passes while I was moving around. So I’ve been lifting consistently for quite a while.

A few weeks ago, a trainer came up to me in the middle of my set and told me that some members had complained about my sweaty smell.
Now, I know no one smells like flowers and rainbows while working out, but I always wear freshly washed clothes, prep before the gym, and use deodorant.
In all my years of training, no one has ever said anything like that to me. I even asked former gym buddies and people I used to run with in the middle of summer, and they all said I smell completely normal.

I don’t want to assume the worst, but I’m starting to feel like this might be a racist thing.
I’m a foreigner living in a small village, and at this gym, I’m one of the very few people who lift seriously. Most of the members are older and go more for general mobility than weight training.

1k7gc2m,mozgdl6,KING_Pipoo,2025-04-25 15:24:36,"Hey guys,

I'm currently following a routine given by a coach I hired at a commercial gym. At first, I was making decent progress, but now I feel like I've stalled on some exercises altogether—I can’t seem to add more weight or reps no matter what approach I try.


I'm a 33-year-old male, 169 cm tall, and currently weigh 70 kg. When I started about a year ago, I was 62 kg. My short-term goal was to reach my current weight, and my long-term goal is to steadily gain strength by adding reps or weight at the beginning of each month.


Here’s my 4-day routine:

Day 1 – Chest and Triceps

4 x 12–15 close grip push-ups

4 x 6–8 barbell bench press (I've been stuck at 50 kg for a couple of months)

4 x 8–10 dumbbell incline bench press (20 kg)

4 x 8–10 incline dumbbell fly (14 kg)

4 x 10–12 dumbbell pullover (22 kg)

4 x 8–10 French press on bench (stuck at 12 kg)

4 x 6–8 seated French press (stuck at 22–26 kg)

4 x 8–10 triceps pulldown (23 kg)


Day 2 – Back and Biceps

4 x 6–7 close grip pull-ups (stuck at 7 max)

4 x 8–10 lat pulldown (52 kg)

4 x 8–10 seated row machine (stuck at 50 kg)

4 x 8–10 T-bar row (25–30 kg)

4 x 6–8 barbell bicep curls (can’t get past 15 kg)

4 x 6–8 cable bicep curls (18 kg)

4 x 8–10 concentration curls (10 kg) [I've been trying Scott curls instead]


Day 3 – Legs and Abs

4 x 6–8 Smith machine squats (60 kg)

4 x 8–10 fixed lunges with dumbbells (7 kg)

4 x 6–8 leg press (120 kg)

4 x 6–10 leg extension (54 kg)

4 x 6–8 seated leg curl (41 kg)

3 x 15 hanging leg raises and hanging oblique leg raises


Day 4 – Upper Body and Shoulders

4 x 8–10 dumbbell front raises (10 kg)

4 x 8–10 dumbbell lateral raises (10 kg)

4 x 8–10 rear delt pec fly (36 kg)

4 x 8–10 seated dumbbell press (18 kg)

4 x 12–15 barbell wrist curls (supination and pronation, 5 kg)

4 x 8–10 dumbbell alternate chest press with twist (20 kg)

4 x 8–10 single-arm seated row machine (25 kg)


How I go about my routine is pushing to 1–2 reps shy of failure and always putting in effort—I try to go out of breath with each exercise or at least get my heart pumping. I've tried techniques like 2–3 reps with 20 seconds of rest on exercises I’m hard-stuck with, but haven’t seen meaningful progress. I’ve also tried lowering reps and adding more weight, but most exercises just end up looking like baby reps or having terrible form.


I've worked with a couple of nutritionists, and the last one recommended the following daily macros:

2350 cal

140–160 g protein

50–60 g fat

280–300 g carbs


My main concern is whether the routine is good and worth sticking to, or if I should make changes. While progress has been slow, there has been some, so I'm not sure if the routine itself is the issue. About five years ago, I used to go to the gym 3–5 days a week, but I stopped a year into the pandemic. I started back roughly 10 months ago, and this time I’m trying to take it seriously.",1,0.1435

1k7gc2m,mp01ioe,Cocacolaloco,2025-04-25 17:06:52,"I’m wondering about changing up my exercise routine. Well first of all I don’t do anything super regularly but I have orangetheory 8x/ mo. I realize since I go so randomly it’s probably not that helpful. I have another gym as well that I can go anytime and they have fun cardio and yoga classes. Downside is I now don’t live close enough to walk and it’s sometimes a pain to drive and find parking. 

I’m guessing if I even just went on two 20 min walks most days that might be better since it’d be every day mostly. I would like to do yoga regularly too but it’s harder to do at home and I like it in the gym better. I also am considering starting ballet classes but I’d have to quit orangetheory since they’re close in cost. 

Anyway the goal is to just try to be more toned and maybe lose like 10 pounds. I look fine but I know I gained a bit since being in a relationship and sitting at work. I feel like I eat ok as I eat only until full but now he’s often buying me coffee which I didn’t have before and I’m sure has a good amt of sugar. And other things like that lol.

Most people in this sub don’t know what bodyfat percentages look like, leading to them estimating inaccurately. Also whenever someone wants their bodyfat estimated, you should post a pic of your legs and back as well. Just showing the front of your torso makes it harder to guess accurately. 

One of the only accurate methods of bodyfat testing is getting an MRI but that’s very expensive and a doctor isn’t going to give you one just to see your bodyfat percentage.

Do you regularly increase the weight you lift? Every barbell workout I do means an increase in weight. Even if the increase is microplates added to the bar, it is still an increase. Progressive overload, with regular de-load weeks to recover, is how you get results. 

I do planned month-long workout blocks where the barbell emphasis for a few blocks might be on volume (lower weights, higher reps) or on weight (higher weights, lower reps). I also do accessory  exercises in each workout (dumbbells, cable machines, TRX, etc.)

Do you do any core workouts—planks, Pahloff holds/Pahloff presses, deadbugs, etc? While weight training can indirectly work your core, I always do at least one core exercise per workout. I don’t recall seeing core exercises on your workout.

I ask because most people, including me, have *no idea* how to structure an effective workout. That’s why I have a coach. If I didn’t have a coach, I’d follow a structured workout plan by someone more knowledgable than me, and modify it where necessary.

I agree with what other people have said—your workouts are simply not effective after 10 years of lifting. Time to try something different.

This is a red flag. Something is up, either you’re not pushing hard enough or you’re executing the movements incorrectly. 

Next time you work out, I’d strongly advise either setting up your phone somewhere or asking someone to record it for you. There are many places to get a form check, or you can send me the video and I can give some critiques. 

But in general:
- If your last rep isn’t slower than your first rep, you’re not close to failure
- Don’t cheat range of motion 
- Don’t ego lift
- Don’t drop the weight, make sure to control it 
- Get your form good",5,0.6598

I walk 15,000 steps a day, mostly on a treadmill at 6–6.4 km/h (about 1.5 hours), with around 3,000 steps coming from general movement at home.

Our other benches are a very narrow adjustable bench and a bench that used to incline but doesn't anymore. Both are very wobbly.

I was thinking I'd be weaker without the stability of the flat bench, but this rant has a happy ending. Monday night, I tried benching with the broken bench (it's a Body-Solid, ironically).

Right now i have the following workout, and i'm wondering if there's any muscle group i've forgotten about?

**3 days of light jogging a week**

**Day 1: Stretching/yoga**

**Day 2: Climbing**

**Day 3: Lower body**

* 90/90 *Warmup*
* Thigh stretch *Warmup*
* Side plank clamshell with band
* Glute bridge with band
* Kettle bell goblet squats (16 kg)
* Kettle bell deadlift (sometimes Romanian for variation) (16 kg)

**Day 4: Upper body**

* Wall angels *Warmup*
* Shoulder pole stretch *Warmup*
* Pushups
* Deadbug
* Superman angels
* Dumbbell rows (16 kg)

I feel like I'm hitting everything important, but let me know if you can spot anything i am missing. 🙃",2,-0.6966

In the meantime, I’m looking for some routinr feedback in case my freestyle “use all the machines” plan is totally missing any major muscle groups or important exercises for general fitness. Routine below (copied from notes app, weights are still steadily rising every few days).

I start with a few minutes on the rowing machine to get the heart running and then, ~3ish days a week, I do some combination of 6-8 of the following exercises based on vibes/machine availability (with special attention to do any exercises I skipped the previous day) aiming for 1-2 reps away from failure or just going to failure:

Leg press 145 10x3

Chin up 105 8x3

Shoulder press 30 8x3

Leg curl 85 10x3

Leg extension 55 10x3

Ab crunch 100 10x3

Bicep curl 10 12x3

Chest dip 95 10x3

Chest press 35 

Lat pulldown 65 10x3

Seated row 55 10x3

I recently started my 2nd cycle of the 531 beginner workout program after doing my own routine for the past 12 to 18 months. (https://thefitness.wiki/routines/5-3-1-for-beginners/ this program)


Today was day 3 of week 2, so squat & bench + accessories day. My barbell bench press AMRAP was 5 x 80kg(176lbs). My squat AMRAP was 6 x 85kg (187lbs). (For completeness my deadlift AMRAP is 6 x 122kg(268lbs) & my OHP AMRAP is 6 x 45kg (99lbs)).


Any idea why my squat is so weak compared to my other lifts? What additional exercises can I do to help strengthen it?


When I'm doing the squat AMRAP set I know my legs have more in them, but after rep 6 today I started seeing black spots and my body felt incredibly fatigued - but i think i had a few more reps in my legs... once I racked the bat and took a few breaths i felt fine again like i could go and do another 4 or 5 (but followed the program dropping the weight down and doing the 5x5).

When cutting, I have been doing 1500 calories a day.

I’m getting back into working out after a full 2-year break due to personal reasons. During that time, I gained quite a bit of weight (around 95kg now), and I’m really trying to get back to the level I was at before.

That said, since restarting, I’ve been experiencing lower back pain during ab circuits (sit-ups, flutter kicks, etc.). I suspect it's due to weak core strength and hip flexors after all this time off (but that’s just my guess). Feel free to share any other explanations if anyone has insights

I’ve looked up a few programs, but I haven’t found any follow-along circuit videos that help me focus on proper form while also targeting the right muscles. If anyone has recommendations for routines or videos that could help me build back a solid foundation, I’d really appreciate it.

I (34F) am very fit - I have visible muscle and lift heavy. A guy who works in memberships came over to me as I was warming up in the squat rack. He asked what I was training and we started talking. I told him I have a trainer and he goes “well, she clearly doesn’t know what she’s doing. I see how you workout and you’re all over the place.” Okay, rude - moving on. He continues to go on about how shitty my trainer is and that I need to train with him. I tell him no, he keeps begging and trash talking my coach. Finally, he’s like “how about we split 50/50, she gets you half the month, I get you the other half.” NO! I finally told him that I will use her until the day I die and he backs off a little. 

He asks if he can show me something…sure? He starts unracking my squat rack which already had 175lbs on it! While he’s showing me this exercise, he asks about my nutrition and I tell him my trainer just put me at 2500 calories. He goes, “bullshit, you need more. You need 2800 because you need to put on size.” He then proceeds to imply multiple times that my butt is flat and that I can only grow my glutes if I use him. He also tells me I need to see a chiropractor because I have an anterior pelvic tilt. He was with me for 30min and the whole entire time he was criticizing me and my trainer. 

He eventually asks what protein powder I use and I tell him. He googles my protein and goes “your protein is shit! That’s why you’re losing weight and not building any muscle. You need to buy the protein from here.” I’m furious at this point and he goes on to give me a backhanded compliment saying “you’re pretty fit.” Excuse me? I’m one of the strongest women in this gym. 

He was constantly attacking me, putting me down and criticizing my body. I almost left the gym in tears, I was so upset. And the level of detail he had about my training means that he is watching me closely. The gym is my happy place and now I feel uncomfortable and unsafe.

And the kicker, the first time I ever talked to him he asked me if I competed in bodybuilding. So clearly my training is working!!

End rant.

The routine: (A few years ago, I joined a program at the gym that was more strength training based vs hypertrophy I'd say). We'd do first 15 minutes of a couple exercises like box jumps and kettlebell swings. And then the next 45 minutes would be lifting (full body), like 2 leg exercises (we'd rotate between squat variation, deadlift, RDL's), 1-2 exercises for back (pull-ups and single arm dumbbell rows, maybe something with a cable sometimes), bench press for chest, and single arm dumbbell press for shoulders. The rep scheme would typically be around 3x8. My plan is to do this 3x a week. 

When I first started this, I only did this twice a week and I lost 20 pounds in 10 months with no changes in diet and I maintained that for 8-9 months easy. Then after that, I moved and didn't know what to do and I gained weight. I'm 6 pounds heavier now and thinking of following that routine with the same exercises (cuz I loved them and need a routine that incorporates these, especially bulgarian split squats!).

Hello ! 
I’m new here, never really been in the gym before.
I mostly do outdoor activities (Trail Running, Climbing, hiking, ski touring in winter…),
But for all of April I’m stuck abroad for work, and the surroundings of my hotel don’t allow for any outdoor activity
So I’ve decided to hit the gym at the hotel to try to maintain (or improve ?) my fitness.
The idea being mainly going specific for my preferred activities so I don’t loose too much when I get back
I don’t really want to bulk because I don’t want to get bigger ^^ but loosing some fat mass would of course be nice
I’ve looked at several dedicated programs for climbing and a bit of running strength training, and here’s what I made myself :

** Treadmill Running 3x /week (1x easy 40min, 1x intervals (either speed or incline), 1x long run
** Strength training 2x /week like this : 

Super set #1 
4x sets with 3min rest : 
Weighted Pull Ups 5x reps +12kg
Squats with dumbbells 5x reps +30kg

Superset #2 
4x sets with 3min rest : 
Bench Press (dumbbells) 5x reps +36kg
One arm bench Low rows with dumbbell 5x reps +20kg

Superset #3 : 
4x sets 3min rest : 
Shoulder press (with a machine) 7x reps +21kg
Leg curl (machine) 6x reps +42kg

Superset #4 : 
4 sets 3min rest : 
Bulgarian squat 5reps 12kg
Straight Leg raises x10

Regarding climbing I’m just trying to stay fit and gain some upper body strength without bulking
Regarding trail running I’ve got 2 races planned next couple of months, and it’s worth mentioning that on many previous races I’ve experienced cramps in my adductors and quads, which I think are due do lack of strength. I am paying great attention to hydration and food before and during the races


That’s it !

For women, fat is harder to reduce past a certain point. If you have longer limbs, shorter abdominal section and you tend to store fat there as opposed to legs, you probably need to expect to work harder and longer than other athletes to see your abs.

Yes, I was doing basketball at the same time, I had to opt for two sessions

>I'm curious, what is the top set/back up set method?

It's not really a method, it's more of a guideline. The idea is to progress on your first set for each exercise, but particularly on the first set for that body part. If you fail, you then try to progress on your backup set. If you managed, you still try, but it's not that important.

In a traditional sets and reps approach, you usually have RIR on the first set, then less on subsequent ones, here it's more the opposite. Your first set is always try hard, and if you need the rest, you take it on the follow up sets. Instead of looking like 10-10-9, your sets look like 15-12-8. Next session, instead of improving on the third set and get 10-10-10, you try to do 16-[whatever but above 11]-[whatever 8 is good].

I was already on my way to do that before, I had a pre-exhaust ramp up on my dips and pullups before single working sets, but really what triggered the change was when my kid was an infant and I only had 20min to workout during his naps, I made sure if I got only one set in, it was a working set.",2,0.9319

**Q.2 Is this kind of ""patchwork"" routine dangerous, or can I keep going with it ?**

I (25M) can't stick to a programm if I don't enjoy it, haven't been able to stick to a well-known workout plan for that reason. I read the FAQ, so I wanted to go ahead and say it ; I realise it's not the most optimal routine, but I'm not looking for crazy massive gains. I want to have fun exercising, and not it being a chore. I actually have been enjoying this training and look forward to it now and sticking to it for the past 5 months, with some variations/evolutions.

*To make reading easier, I do all my gym workout in a 3-sets-of-12 set up, so I won't be repeating that everytime.*

**Day 1 - calisthenics :**

* I go to the street workout park running, 20min there and 20min back
* Pushups (pausing at the bottom of rep) + dips + triceps bench dips + stretched lunges, a bit of ab wheel (just started that, can't go into a full ROM, knees on the ground)
* Pull ups (3x5-6), after an increase in the volume I could do, my form has improved to be pretty clean (full dead-hang and chin above bar), but I've been plateauing for a while: can't get more volume, can't get chest-to-bar. My PR is barely 10rep, butchering the end a bit

**Day-2 Gym - Back workout :**

* Lat pull downs (43kg)  |  Shoulder press (41kg)  | One-arm rowing (16kg)  |  Rear delt fly (39kg)  | seated rows (39kg)  |  Roman chair back extension (with 10kg)

**Day-3 - Climbing gym**

I will spend about 1h30 there, climbing around a 6A level

**Day-4 Gym - Legs and whatever I feel like doing :**

* Squats (80kg)  |  Hip abduction (39kg)  | Calves raises (18kg)  |  Leg press (90kg) or Prone leg curl (30kg)  |  Bulgarian squats (the nightmare... 14kg)
* I then add 2-3 exercises of what I feel like doing on that day, usually a mix of pecs and biceps/triceps
   * Dumbell press (16kg)   |   Pec fly (love the stretch, 52kg)  | Triceps pull (18kg) or machine (54kg)  | Hammer curl (9kg)

I'm all for getting help if I'm doing something wrong, I'm open to suggestions and I'm not an expert. They're all lovely, all enthusiastic and polite. That said...I get interrupted often enough between sets by them introducing themselves politely and asking if they can make a suggestion, that it's started to be distracting every time one of them walks behind me in the middle of a set. I start second guessing my form, and I've actually noticed that any kind of independent arm movement like lifting dumbbells becomes less coordinated as soon as one of them walks near me because I'm losing focus.

When it's about my technique or form, cool. But when it's to suggest an alternative exercise, it's getting a bit annoying. At the same time, refusing their help feels like kicking a puppy when they've summoned up the nerve to approach a stranger at their new job. It's a different one almost every time, so it isn't like any one of them individually is doing anything wrong!

I spent months doing PT rotator cuff exercises, because I thought that shoulder problems = rotator cuff problems. Recently though I had a massage and the therapist took a full inventory of my arm. Turns my coracobrachialis and pec minor muscles were incredibly tender and tight. I didn’t even know they existed!

1jzn7a6,mnfqvy6,NorthQuab,2025-04-16 16:53:35,"Few things I think could use emphasis, more important for oly lifting but apply pretty broadly

* I think people can over-emphasize stretching/mobility, but a good general warmup including dynamic stretches is excellent for performance and injury prevention, and it's something a lot of people neglect. If your shit is hurting, you may not need to do anything more than a bit of activation work in your warmups to get everything firing.

* Address your injuries proactively - you shouldn't be feeling sharp pain while you're training, if you are something is going wrong and you got to fix it. Fixing it doesn't mean taking time off (although that may be part of it), but it does mean figuring out why your knees/shoulders/etc. are being over-stressed and addressing the root cause. This doesn't mean you have to freak out about every little ache/twinge but it does mean you need to stop popping ibuprofen like tic-tacs instead of seeing a physio that works with lifters/athletes

* Consistency is really all that matters for strength training, both in recovery and in training, so quit fucking around with your programming/exercise selection/micronutrients if you're missing gym sessions or not getting your protein in every day. Any mental energy spent determining the perfect bicep curl variation to use is far better spent finding ways to ensure that you get all your programmed work done.

* Related to the above - I think the best high-level approach to training is to make things as easy as you can on yourself so that you can stay consistent. Find ways to make training as fun as it can be so you show up and get your work done, and avoid trying to implement habits that are difficult to maintain and have marginal positive impact. The former for me was just making training more social/finding a good training group so that I have that accountability structure/have more fun in the gym hanging out with folks, and the latter for me was just not over-committing to excessive volume/not being too draconian with nutrition. Went from having to constantly psych myself up to get into the gym to effortlessly staying on-plan for months, and it's been ~nice~",2,0.984

since it's Monday, I got two questions that might be moronic:


1) how much does cutting affect your lifting weights and performance? So far, I've been able to keep my weights and reps, some I could raise slightly, but moving them becomes harder and harder, and I need more rest between sets.


2) how important is clean eating for losing fat and getting to see them abs? I've been cutting before, so I know CICO works, but I'm not the cleanest eater and fear it might affect my goal. E.g. I haven't eaten today yet, and was thinking of treating myself to Asian buffet or even Burger King (love that whopper) after my workout today. Alternative is hitting a store and buying some stuff for cold dinner (cheese, meat, bread), as I'm staying in a hotel all week (no water heater or stove available)

Buying a Spinbike/Home Stationary bike worth it? I'm creating a new discussion because it seems like the latest posts are over 5-10 years ago which makes me concerned if this tool is completely irrelevant now.

Background: Our neighborhood suddenly started locking the basketball court in front of my house every 10 p.m. up until 4 am. Most probably, it's because of the noise and the people in the area started complaining on the noise of the basketball bouncing and the ring clanking everytime somebody plays in the middle of the night. Fair enough, I totally get that since somedays, some players get into a fist fight whenever they don't pay the losing bet. The only issue is that I jog there every 1 am and it became a habit of mine.

As a working student, it's so fucking difficult finding the time to workout especially if I'm super tired with academics and having to do a full time job at night. For context, I work 9 hours at night and 7-8 hours at school every weekdays and Saturday. I only get sundays off but I do acads stuff that day.

I recently bought a pull up bar, bench press and 40kg dumbells and went from 88kg back in November 2024 to 77.5kg today. I am really proud of this but I miss the cardio, tbh. Apparently, a rough breakup is sucu a good motivation to improve yourself.

Can I just go for a run in my neighborhood? Yes, but the reason why I jog on the basketball court in front of our house is because it's close enough where I could still be within 100 meters away from my work pc (I work at home) and answer any important emails that comes through. I usually do my workouts at nights and just slap it in their while I am working.

I would honestly love to buy a bike but when it is 42°c during the day, compunded with having poor urban infrastructure to support biking in my city/country, and horrible drivers, I am leaning towards not buying it as I see it as not worth it because:

A. I could get hit by vehicles or get stuck in traffic especially during the mornings.

B. Its fucking hot or its always raining when its not.

C. I need to go far to get in cardio whereas I could spend that time sleeping at home and taking power naps.

Also, I already have a motorcycle that I use to go to school so I do not need another form of transportation.

I tried running after shift but whenever I do it, I would often lose energy and focus during the day at school or whenever I do it after, I am extremely tired where it just sucks. Right now, I am trying to do jump ropes but it keeps fucking up my knees as I am not good with it yet.

I recently found a cheap $60-$80 spinbike/stationary bike online that I am keen on trying out. I tried treadmills and it fucking sucks and boring. Realistically, I probably will not be able to afford a good one anyways as a broke college student. The sub $100 ones suck and can only be used for walking.

My only downside for a spinbike is maybe it is boring and takes up too much space in our small apartment. But, I just want to find a way to keep moving and doing cardio while there is a downtime at my work or whenever I don't need to study.

Will this purchase make sense?

Biting the bullet asking for critique, aware this may be a faux pas so mods feel free to delete if so.

**Training age:** History of c.5 years serious strength training, then a five-year layoff to January this year. Have been running Greyskull LP with a focus on strength since then and glad to say the rate of return of strength and size has been really good.  
**Prior Programs:** Starting Strength, 5/3/1, Candito 6 Week, PHUL, Greyskull (all but Greyskull run years ago)

**Stats:** 29 y/o, 5'10 98kg (currently on a cut, about 20% bf)  
**e1RM:** SQ 165kg, BP 132kg, D 170kg, OHP 68kg

**Program aim:** To move away from the strength-focussed training I have always done and towards hypertrophy work to build a more balanced physique and generally try something new and have fun. I have noticed all the old aches and pains I had from lifting years ago have basically come back and I am sick of feeling ""crunchy"", in particular I have a bad right SI joint that is just annoying me in day-to-day life.

I therefore want to cut back on squats and deadlifts, and introduce higher reps and things I've never really done like vertical pulls/rows and lots of arm work. I want to focus predominantly on growing the muscles that are weak points for me with my history of focusing on S/B/D.

**Proposed split:** A four-day Upper/""Lower"" split with each day built around a main compound lift and then accessories. Maybe slightly contradictory to my aim to pivot from strength work, but I do enjoy compounds still, particularly my presses.

I have been using MacroFactor and successfully be losing weight, I would assume I am around 20% body fat currently. My goal is to lose my stubborn love handles. I decided to do some online coaching that involves a diet plan, and the plan they’ve given me consists of pretty much identical meals every day, only Whole Foods with protein pan fried with a bit of oil etc. it’s day 3, and I feel horrible eating the same things every day. Plus, it’s extremely inconvenient with my working pattern, having to eat a proper lunch.

Before working out, I usually eat a small portion of Greek yogurt with some granola. The thing is, I get home pretty late (around 8:30–9:00 PM), and I’ve heard that metabolism slows down at night.
Since I’m trying to lose weight, I usually eat dinner focused on protein. My question is: Should I still eat dinner after working out, or would it be better to have it before the workout? I'm concerned that eating too late might lead to storing fat instead of using the nutrients to recover muscle.

I did a lower 1 day and noticed that after lunges my legs are destroyed, but with the leg press I got a nice glute stimulus perhaps because my quads were tired? This will be even more exaggerated in lower 2 day with 3 exercises.  
Is this too much volume for quad based exercises? Can this be bad for knees?

My question is, do you think it would be beneficial to add some weighted torsion rotations to hit the oblique, for example instead of the leg raises or alternating workout to workout? Or is hitting the oblique wasted energy and is, for the casual male gym goer working for aesthetics, hitting abs enough?",1,-0.3296

My lift progression started to slow about 3 weeks ago and is now basically fully stalled. I know it's not reasonable to expect strength gain/muscle growth whilst in a deficit like this but I was hopeful that being in my 'newbie gains' phase would mean I could still gain at least a bit of strength whilst cutting.

Is this normal and just something I have to put up with until I begin eating more? Or is there anything I should try tweaking?

1jxazfq,mmsze4j,keenkidkenner,2025-04-12 22:19:48,"Here to vent and also ask for advice. Are there any gym owners and/or managers reading this? Here's what happened:

I'm a member of a HIIT/strength class-based gym in which boxing is always one component. The gym provides gloves for a fee, or you can bring your own. I don't use my gloves anywhere else, so I like to leave mine in the car when I'm not at the gym to make things simpler. The other day I couldn't find them ANYWHERE. I petsit, so I thought perhaps I accidentally brought them into one of the houses I was at. I texted my most recent clients, and tried to think back to when I last saw them. This process took a couple days. Since I had no luck there, I reached out to the gym. I told them I had thought they were elsewhere but determined that I must have left them at the gym and it was weird I couldn't find them. (I had left them behind one time before and found them next class no problem - I always feel a bit dumb and scatterbrained after my workouts, as though all my energy is supporting my muscles and not my brain. Not sure if this is common, or just a me thing.) They pointed out that the first of the month had just rolled around, and they donate everything left behind on the 1st! Well, after going back through my booked class history, I determined the last time I had used my gloves was the 31st. :/ So, I left my gloves at the gym and within 12 hours the gym had donated my gloves. I was incredibly frustrated that they wouldn't even give me a full day to claim my property. I suggested they perhaps implement a new system, because it seemed like a system that threw people's stuff out in less than a day was kind of a shitty one. I was surprised when their response was really un-empathetic. It boiled down to ""yeah that sucks"" and ""well there are signs everywhere"" and they really didn't seem to register the fact that the signs don't matter because I didn't realize I left my gloves there until well after they had been donated! Look, I get it. It was my fault I left them behind, not their liability, blah blah blah. But I wouldn't be frustrated at them if another member had taken them or if they at least expressed some empathy. 

tl;dr: Left my gloves behind on the evening of the 31st at my gym, they had been donated to goodwill by the 1st. Gym expresses no remorse. 

Question: For all gym owners and managers: how does your lost and found work? Is there a ""system""? Does it get shoved in a box and never seen again? are things placed on a shelf so everyone can see them? Do you donate every month? six months? Do you date things at all? Would love to know if anyone has a setup that works really well to A) not be hugely burdensome on gym staff, and B) not piss off members by getting rid of their things all the time. I'd like to provide my gym with some concrete suggestions so this doesn't happen again.

  
Question 2: If you were the owner in this case, would you offer me anything? I was sort of expecting them to do SOMETHING nice as a gesture, like free rentals for a certain period, or a discount on new gloves (they do sell some), or a discount off next month's membership. But I don't know what might be typical in this case.

My goal is to improve my overall health and not feel constantly tired and sleepy. I spend a lot of time sitting at work and then just sleeping at home, skipping meals a lot of time because I just don't have any appetite or am tired to cook or even just eat precooked meals.  

What I do so far -> threadmill since it was the easiest equipment to use at first, some exercises on a mat (which I take from youtube videos), back extension, lat pulldown, hip adductor/abductor machine, squats with dumbbells, elliptic trainer. (I know I'm all over the place, hence the need for the routine). 

Results so far -> 
1: I like doing cardio a lot, allows me to just de-stress after work without the need to count or think about things (reps, which exercise after which, sets). 
2: I feel like I'm gaining appetite and drinking more water. 

Fear -> I don't want to lose fat or weight as I'm already skinny and weak as it is, I don't mind gaining muscle. (26F, 47kg on a bloated day).

* Bench Presses
* Bent-Over Rows
* Arnold Press

After barbell curls - as of recent - I've added two isolation exercises such as finger curls and overhead tricep extensions to develop my arms; and with all of the those exercises from Allpro I've gained a great deal of progress, especially since I can only manage to do 2 days per week.

At 136 lbs down from 160 earlier this year. Heavy lifting, some cardio, eating less. 1.5 years post partum and had 3 kids in less than 4 years.

Though I am dealing with a bout of anemia currently, I’ve been starting to struggle with energy and my lifts are suffering. I have zero appetite, likely because my adhd meds are working better at a lower weight.

I wanted to cut to 120 ish before maintaining, because I wanted to lose that lower belly pouch above my csection scar, but idk if 10-15 more pounds will improve that area or just come off of everywhere else. Im having no problem losing weight, simply because I can’t be bothered to eat. I had considered glp-1 a few months ago, but apparently once I got below 145 or so, my appetite just went away. 

Trying to determine if it’s worth it or not to keep pushing to 120. I like my body literally everywhere except my lower stomach. It gives me a lot of self doubt/insecurity. But…I also miss hitting PRs on lifts and not feeling like garbage ☹️

I’ve lifted on and off for the past 4 years, finding success running GZCLP at first, but running into injury issues due to a weak core.

I have a 5 year old, 2 year old and 5 month old at home making it tough to get to the gym with regularity, and recently had a small surgery (mole removal) forcing me to shut down all workouts for a few weeks.

Once the surgery is healed, l’d like to get back into a normal routine, both for mental health purposes and feel good about the way my clothes fit. I have a set of dumbbells and a bench at home, a set of dumbbells at my work gym where I can get to at lunch, and can hit the gym with barbells probably twice a week if I’m up at 530.

All of that excessive detail is to set up the question - who has a routine for me that can help me get back into a lifting habit, using what options I have available in a busy schedule?",2,0.7469

In the experience of those who live a fit lifestyle, I'm wondering if My lifting pull day was canceled out and wasted completely if I decided to go out and have some drinks with friends later that night, and by drinks i mean 6-7 a beer and mixed drinks, while drinking water and electrolytes during the drinking session to help mitigate dehydration but the next day my muscles were sore as usual and I still felt as though I had gotten a good workout in. I did get about 7 hours of sleep and feel generally fine the next day. Even though I feel like I normally would after a good lifting day, did the alcohol completely waste my work. Online says yes and also says maybe not all of it. Whats your guys' opinion/experience on this question? I would like some feedback for the future. I appreciate it!",1,0.977

Day 1 (Heavy lifting so these 4 usually takes 50min):
Benchpress
Dips (weighted)

Cable rows

Day 2 (rep day; less weight):
Incline Bench
Chest fly
Pull ups (weighted)
Dips (max reps; unweighted)
Shoulder raises
Bicep curls

I’ve reached a point where I get muscle strain from weighted dips, so thinking of changing those exercises for something else, but can’t figure out what to so. Thought about military press but my back has some issues so really difficult not to arch.

1jv19a1,mm7io8t,KeplerFame,2025-04-09 13:29:50,"I've been running like 20 minutes every day on the treadmill, and I'm trying to increase my cardio progressively. My current stamina isn't the best, and I'd say I'm below average or just around average as of now. So a question arose on my mind, what is more effective/better? Running 20 minutes over an interval of 1x20 minutes (meaning running 20 minutes non-stop) or 2x10 minutes, (running 10 minutes twice with a break of 5-10 minutes in between) Or even, 15-5 or 5-15. Is there a difference between each of these routines? I personally find it hard to run 20 minutes non stop and get very exhausted, but I can run 10-10 fairly well, and the 10 minute break really helps me. Just for reference, I'm a Male in my 20's, and I run on 8km/h.

Also just a small question, how important is stretching before running? I've been stretching for around 5 minutes before each workout. Is it very helpful, or just negligible?

(again this is probably not the best workout but I want something with this type of intensity, Also I didn't add reps or sets because I am not trying to get this routine rated, just explaining what I would like to do) So my main questions come down to: 1.

HIIT Workout #1 (I do each of these with dumbbells for 30 secs, followed by 30 secs of jumping jacks, then 30 secs of rest, then on to the next one):    
* DB Curl    
* Tricep Kickbacks    
* DB Overhead Press    
* Hammer Curl    
* Overhead Triceps Extension    
* DB Arnold Presses

* DB Bench Press    
* Lying Pullover    
* DB Chest Flys    
* Bent Over Rows    
* Bent Over Reverse Flys    
* Upright Standing Rows

5. Barbell Curls: 3 sets × 8-10 reps
6. Face Pulls: 3 sets × 15-20 reps

2. Romanian Deadlifts: 3 sets × 8-10 reps
3. Leg Press: 3 sets × 10-12 reps
4. Calf Raises: 4 sets × 15-20 reps
5. Planks: 3 sets × 60 sec

1jtfbm7,mltz39l,MassiveManTitties,2025-04-07 08:22:22,"Stupid question alert (I guess here is the place for it)...!

Currently doing starting Keto and doing light exercise with the intention of weight loss and general health/fitness. Not fussed about getting ripped or anything or hyper athleticism.

Using a Garmin watch to track activity, and Chronometer to track food.

Baseline maintenance calories on Garmin and checked with other sources comes out as ballpark 2200 kcal, daily activity comes out at around 1700-2500 kcal (walking couple of KM to work n back, exercise bike), giving a TDEE of around 3900-4700 kcal.

Using various Keto calculators for my size/weight it's putting my macros at around;

140g protein

30g carbs

105g fat

However when I input these into Chronometer it gives me a 1600 kcal total energy target, and then says 'totals don't match' against a 2200 kcal energy target (i.e. around my baseline, with my exercise being the deficit for weight loss).

Should be some scope for some calories there that aren't macros (? is that a thing beyond like, alcohol and the like?) and that it's suggesting a daily deficit of around 2000 kcal - which seems very extremely - possibly dangerously so?

Previously when on MFP a few years ago when I managed to lose an equivalent amount of weight (before having a kid and putting it all back on...) it wasn't like this, and would let me set (I assume broadly similar) macros like the above and a daily target of ballpark 2200.

My question is;

\- Am I doing something wrong in my macro calcs/setting up Cronometer/inputting them wrong.

\- Am I using calculators for fit people when I'm a fat fuck?

\- Is Cronometer fundamentally doing something different to MFP?

\- Is my watch way overestimating my exercise levels? Am I over exercising? Under eating/setting wrong goals?

Something isn't quite adding up somewhere and I'm not sure what...",3,-0.9482

After that I went to the gym for my normal workout and my performance was pretty poor, I still put the effort in but hit failure a lot earlier than I would usually.

My plan is to hit BJJ 3 times per week and on those days do a light PPL day. Other 3 days per week will be just lifting and do a heavy PPL day. Sunday will be a full rest day. Cutting at the moment and doing more bodybuilder style training so not as heavy on the body as my usual strongman stuff, more high reps and controlled movements.

What do I do now. 

So, I have just successfully completed a 3 month cut. Where I went from 73kg to 65kg. 

I had started on 2200 calories, and ended up at 1500. 


I thought that I’d be able to handle an aggressive cut at the end of the cut, but it seems I am just mentally burnt out. 

From reading online, I’ve decided the next best step for me is to go through a maintenance phase. 

My question is, how long should this phase be. And should I jump directly to my maintenance calories, or reverse diet up to my maintenance?

And if I were to reverse up. How would I go about it? Increase by X amount every 10 days?

- plates: 2-25's, 2-35's, 2-45's. 
- full rack with pull up
- bench (incline/decline)
- Sandbags: 150lb, 200lb, up to 300lb

- Assorted bands
- Dip bars

As for the plate issues - I can deadlift my max plates (255) easy, and I squat it with some warm up as well. Bench I can do about 185 for 3-5 reps. At this point I'm not looking to hit PR or anything. I like lifting big. I like doing my sandbags (I can shoulder 200 and do pretty good carries). 

I think in short I just don't know what my goal is anymore? I think it's more I just want to be strong, healthy, and look good for my wife. Which luckily she says I am but...you all know how it is. Get a little bit of a belly or just feel winded at a weird time. Or is this age??

I’ve reviewed my form and it looks fine, I’m slow on the eccentric, not hugging or hunching, I slow my reps and try to make my biceps touch rather than my hands.

* Bench: first time feeling comfortable enough to hit 245 lb without a spotter (not a 1RM pr though), and 225x5 without spotter
* Dips: hit 4x80 lbs added PR (BW ~191 lbs)
* Chin/pull ups: 135/125 lbs added 1RMs
* Squat: 325 lb 1RM pr followed by 225x16 rep PR (probably could have done at least 2 more but felt like I'd pass out)
* Some random exercises: glute ham raise with 40 lbs x 8 reps, 45 degree back extension with 175 lbs x 8 reps,
* Maxed out the gym's dumbbells (120 lbs) for DB rows and had to start adding kettlebells to it
* Maxed out a few machines like leg extension, plate row, for a lot of reps
* Surprised by compliments or being asked for form advice a few times the past couple weeks, which rarely ever happens. I don't feel qualified to give squatting advice lol.

1jr7fa6,mldg9au,sassytexas,2025-04-04 13:45:38,"Question: For someone who has exercised regularly for many years (both weights and cardio in a wide variety/frequency/intensity), is lifting weights more effective for weight loss than cardio? (assuming calorie deficit)

I ask because I’ve heard people say that cardio burns calories while doing it, whereas strength training builds muscle which improves your metabolism which helps you burn more calories throughout the day. I would assume that for someone new to fitness, more focus on weight lifting would definitely be a great way to kick off weight loss. 

However I’m thinking that since I already have a solid foundation, any gains to metabolism would probably be small and therefore more focus on cardio is probably the better way to go? I also am not looking to gain any more muscle and would even be fine losing some during this time",1,0.9582

1jr7fa6,mldwuam,Iiiifoundsweetroad,2025-04-04 15:10:59,"Hi all,

I'm making a maintenance lifting routine to support playing tennis. Goal is to keep muscles, avoid injury, and possibly get a bit stronger, but no huge gains. I'm aiming to lift just 2x/week, supplementing the rest of the week with cardio, mobility, and tennis of course.

The workouts would be four leg exercises, a back exercise, and three core/shoulder ones.

My question is: if I'm only lifting 2x/week, is it better to do the same routine twice for consistency and ability to make progress in an exercise/muscle, or have two different routines to be able to target similar muscles in different ways?

Would it be more difficult to make progress or maintain if I'm doing two different routines? The routines would still follow the same format of 4 legs, 1 back, 3 core/shoulders, but I wouldn't revisit a routine for at least a week, maybe even 8 or 9 days.

Thanks!

Question about 531 and cutting/weight loss. 


I know Jim hates people who ""cut"" and believes them effeminate, but I still need to lose some flab. Gf loves the muscles, but wants to see less flab, and so do I. How do you handle cutting/weight loss? And which template do you use?

1jr7f4e,mldbdbe,SteelAndStardust,2025-04-04 13:17:28,"Mm hard to say. How fat is distributed in your body is largely genetic, so say you lose another 10 kg, it may come primarily off your legs, arms, back, or off your stomach -- no way of telling. What I can see is a lot of your belly comes from loose skin (congrats on losing as much as you did!) so you'll likely always have a bit of a ""sag"" going unless you get surgery to remove it.

Your current BMI got you just out of the ""obese"" category and into the ""overweight"" category. A typical healthy weight for your height is under 75 kg (that's total flat stomach territory). But you got quite some muscle mass going, so you have some leeway to be a bit heavier and still be healthy. I'd say getting to 80 kg would be a huge achievement and would be a great place to stabilise. You can look at whether more weight loss is sustainable for you from that point onward.

If I do Monday’s workout on Tuesday, then that might interfere with next workout’s Compound lift.
So because I did Monday’s workout on Tuesday, that carries over to other days so I have to do T2 bench on Thursday now even though I have T1 Bench on Friday (all because I did monday’s workout on Tuesday)

There was even a gym employee following behind them, silently racking their weights like a janitor after a rock concert. 

So I, weighing in at around 1/3 of what they were lifting for reps, fuelled by the white-hot rage of a woman scorned by her own reproductive system, stalked after them and asked them if they intended to clean up their disaster zone.

I am a sociable person just not early in the morning.

I get up in the morning and I am on a tight schedule to get to the gym and workout because I got to get home to take care of my dog's needs before I have to get ready for work.  I don't drag myself out of bed at 4:30 in the morning every day just to socialize at the gym and it's driving me crazy.  I see the same people there every morning.  They have the same mindset as I do, we exchange our hellos, may make a tiny bit of small talk, then we go about our workouts.  They fucking get it!

Lately this one guy that has been working out at the same time as I do for months decided to start talking to me all of the sudden and I fucking hate it....One reason is he will talk to me for over 20 mins or so and it puts me in a bind where I am having to make up for the 20 mins, I missed because of him talking and having to cram everything into the last half of my workout.  He also tends to talk to me on the days I show up late and barely have 30 mins of workout time......

It's getting to a point I don't even want to get out of my car when I see his car there and I hate feeling like I can't work out peacefully.  I am too nice to be mean to someone especially since he has been nothing but, nice to me he just talks to much.  I am also socially awkward since it's so early in the morning my body is still waking up and doesn't know how to function.  I am pretty sure when he first started to get to know me, I told him I like to get in and get out because I am tight on time, and I leave at the same time every SINGLE day and he has totally ignored that.  He'll always end the conversation on ""Well I don't want to hold you up on your workouts any longer so, I'll let you get back to it.""  The rage I feel every time after he says that.",10,0.765

Ive been seeing about a -1.4lb per week.  Lifting heavy (usually 1-2 reps before failure) 5 days a week.

My goal here is to retain as much muscle as possible, while loosing at much body fat as I can.  Ive seen some slight strength decrease so far on my lifts (bench went from 195 to 185).

Home-Made Sour Pickled Cabbage/Leafy Greens

Ingredients:

- Cabbage (or whatever other leaves you want)
- Water
- Salt (2% of the combined weight of water + cabbage)
- A food-safe container large enough that the cabbage doesn't fill more than 3/4 of the volume
- A plate, which also fits in that container

Recipe:

1. Wash your hands. Wash your utensils. Wash the cabbage. Do not wash the salt.

2. Peel a few whole leaves off the cabbage and save them. Chop the cabbage into small pieces (your choice, I tend to go for double bite-sized)

3. Weigh the chopped cabbage. Measure out 2% of that weight in salt and add that in. If you can't weigh your salt refer to the notes at the bottom.

4. Mix the salt and the chopped cabbage thoroughly in the container. Your grandmother would use her hands for this don't be scared.

5. Put the plate (which you cleaned, remember?) on top of the salted cabbage. Stack enough other objects on top of the plate to press the cabbage down.

6. After a few hours the cabbage should have wilted a little and there should be salty leaf water in your container. Add enough water to cover the cabbage, making sure you track how much was added. Add 2% of the extra water's weight in salt. If there's enough cabbage sweat that it's already fully swimming just skip this step.

7. Use the cabbage leaves saved at the beginning of the recipe to cover the chopped cabbage. Press everything down into the salt water. The goal is for all the vegetables to be fully submerged.

8. Let the container sit covered and unrefrigerated for 3-9 days in a dark place. Check every day, push the leaves back under the water and taste the water for sourness. It will be ready to eat faster in a warmer climate. Store in refrigerator when you are satisfied with the taste.

Notes:

- The water should be like a too salty soup; drinkable but not good enough to serve to your family

- Fermentation is a live process. You will know it's working after 2-3 days when the leaves regularly drift above the water's surface and bubbles appear when you press them back down

- You can add other vegetables. Other kinds of greens, cucumbers, peppers, onions, garlic, etc.

- If you notice new colors, new objects, or bad smells in your cabbage it has spoiled or grown mold. The exception is garlic, which will turn blue or green when fermented. If the color spreads to the other vegetables then the garlic is also bad

- The longer you wait the more sour it gets. Keeps in the fridge for a few months, I wouldn't store it outside for longer than 2 weeks at a time",1,-0.4416

So far, I’ve been finding whey protein recipes, and it looks like whey protein binds much much better than pea protein.

I can trade a cashew cream recipe that helps with any rice or potato dish, even steamed potato and kale.

200g cashews

Couple of tablespoons of yogurt of your choice (I can’t do cow, so I do goat, it works fine, soy works fine too)

Juice of half a small lemon (just over a tblspoon)

Just over a tblspoon of apple cider vinegar

Salt to taste (a pinch works fine, 2 tastes better but isn’t necessary)

Soak the cashews overnight. If you are in a hurry, just bring water to a boil, stop the fire, dump the cashews in the water and wait 20min.

Blend everything.

You can add chives and parsley for taste.

I do these things in bulk, so I don’t add fresh garlic as it becomes very pungent after a couple of days, but if you have a few mouths to feed, garlic certainly adds taste and micros.

I do this over packaged cream cheese because can’t do cow and can control salt.

Fairly new to regular fitness. Have been doing this routine for the last two months and am seeing results.  I would however like to confirm I'm not missing anything major/am not putting myself at risk by bundling certain exercises together. 


 Appreciate any feedback. 


I essentially have two routines that I rotate between,with a days rest in between on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I then do a 4th day on Sunday which is light cardio and includes 1 of these two routines at lower intensity. ( mainly to accompany a friend who's started going to the gym). I generally don't do cardio during the week as I have issues with attention-span/ do a lot of walking during my day but am thinking of adding cardio on Tuesday and Thursday for 30-40 minutes after work. 


Please note, I've settled on full body routines due to my schedule. 


Routine A- Monday & Friday
Squats, 4x8 reps
Bench press , 4x8reps
Bent over row, 4x8reps
Shrugs, 4x10reps
Barbell Curls (inside grip), 4x8 reps
Barbell incline press, 4x8reps
Some form of core exercise- crunches mainly


Session B -Wednesday 
Squats, 4x8 reps
Bench press , 4x8reps
Bent over row, 4x8reps
Deadlift, 4x8reps
Shoulder press, 4x8reps
Bicep curls (Barbell or free wights, whatever free), 4x8 reps
Incline bench press, 4x8 reps. 
Some form of core exercise- crunches mainly

1jn8g84,mkinm10,rnbwstx,2025-03-30 13:53:59,"I have a question about setting up a home gym. My (rented) house is relatively small, although I do have a basement. The agreement between my housemates and I is that basement is intended as a multipurpose room - can be used for working out/spreading out a big craft project/etc., with nothing permanent taking up space in the center of the room. I'd like to have a home gym setup where I can do the major compound lifts (squat, bench, deadlift, press, etc). For that, it seems like I would need at least a half squat rack (?), a bench, and a barbell (obviously). How feasible would it be to have an equipment setup that could ""expand"" and ""fold up"" as needed? I know that some styles of benches have wheels on one end - could it be leaned vertically against the wall when not in use? What are other space-conserving ideas that could reduce the footprint of the workout area?


Essentially, I'm weighing whether I want to put effort into setting up a home gym OR shell out for a pricier-than-PF gym membership.

My question comes from making sure I get enough rest and avoid overtraining. Basically, is lifting heavy 4x/wk (Push, pull, legs, shoulders/arms) combined with the yoga sculpt 2-3x per week too much?

Currently I'll use up to 25 lb dumbells during the sculpt but I could cut that down to lighter weights if that's helpful. I really enjoy the classes and would hate to cut them entirely as they're just phenomenal for my cardiovascular fitness. But the priority is the lifting, so if it's necessary than so be it.

So, basically my whole adult life, I've been in this constant cycle of getting quite fit and in good shape, and after that getting lazy for a a year or two and then starting to exercise again. I always get such a high amount of pleasure out of doing cardio when I start and for about six months I get a lot of it easily from that so I keep doing it. And then, when the pleasure comes down, I stop doing it, and often for years.

Any way, the last few times I've done this sporting spree, I've even had tracking of heart rate and other data to see how my performance increases and vo2max estimate increases. And each time, they have done so, rapidly.

But not this time. For about 6 weeks now, I've been super active after doing basically nothing for 1.5 years. My mood, energy has gone up, but my vo2max hasn't increased a bit. I've done work in every heart rate zone. A ton of walking, quite a lot of cycling at 50-65% of max and also elliptical trainer at a little more heavier load and then running, which still gets quite anaerobic quite quickly.

This isn't something that I'm even that after about, mostly I'm just doing sports because it's good for my health and it's fun and a ton of pleasure is what makes it easy to do. But something must explain why this time my vo2max hasn't increased a bit. My resting heart rate has gone down quite a bit already, and my pulse wave velocity has also gotten better.

1jmgxy4,mkdhua4,squogg,2025-03-29 16:12:55,"TL;DR: I am *shook* by the immediate action my local LA Fitness took after word vomiting at the Personal Training Manager on how disappointed I am about this location. Moral of the story: Don't be afraid to speak up about broken equipment - even little annoyances that aren't that big of a deal.



Apparently my membership was randomly ""upgraded"" and I was eligible for a free assessment (aka sales tactic to get me to sign up for PT). I turned it down, and the PT Manager responded with something to the effect of, ""Okay, we just want to make sure you're getting the most out of your workouts and are happy with the gym."" I responded, ""Oh I'm definitely not happy with this gym."" I proceeded to share how I feel like this location is run down and not being kept up very well (there are ""Scheduled for Service"" signs on damn near everything for weeks at a time, sometimes longer) and that I've been considering going to the LAF 5 miles away.  

I asked if the staff make a point to periodically check all the machines to ensure they're in working order. He said they only fix machines when a member reports it. This makes sense because the damn 5 lb. add-on at the lat pulldown machine has needed lubricant for several months and causes major drag if you use it. Nobody's going to take the time to say anything when they can just go grab a 5 lb. plate and carry on with their workout.

After sharing specific examples of broken things at the gym, I apologized for ranting as that was not my intention. He thanked me for the feedback and said he'd share it with the Ops Mgr. I didn't believe him given this gym's track record and shitty online reviews, but it felt good to get that stuff of my chest.

**Literally the very next day,** I noticed three non-LAF people with notepads inspecting every single piece of equipment. Within 72 hours, all the broken paper towel dispensers were fixed. By the end of the week, I saw actual maintenance folks working on the machines 🤯

I currently see an offer for a new set with a 30mm bar and about 110kg of weights for about 340 EUR, plus whatever a shorter bar costs (lack of space for a 170cm long one). 

Thoughts: Thanks to a muscle condition (plus possibly age) I will never be very strong. I don't have a gym nearby that I could use. I'm currently deadlifting 40kg plus bar weight, but I only started again about 3 weeks ago. It's unlikely I'll ever get past the current set for anything but DL and Romanian. But for those I'd need to puzzle with 1.25 and 2.5kg disks just to get past 40kg on the bar. I can't get more weights for my old 25mm bar because I can only move thin cast iron ones with grip due to hand/fingers cramping up, and those are neither available new nor second hand.

1jkzm89,mk0gd9n,whatThisOldThrowAway,2025-03-27 13:58:59,"What factors go into determining the 'severity' of DOMS, in your experience? 

Long story short, life came at me fast in 2025. My training has been intermittent and I've not trained back-squat since December. Holy gee-fuck are the DOMS way more severe than I've ever experienced before. 

I'm trying to work out - as much for my own interest as anything else - why DOMS feel so much more severe now compared to previous times I've taken long breaks from a lift. Basically: Is there something I could've done to cause/avoid more severe DOMS than usual. 

I'm aware that DOMS: varies from person to person; will probably be worse if nutrition is worse; will be worse if the session was more intense; will be worse if you're sedentary in the days following... but as far as I can tell all of these things are roughly the same as they were last time I took a long break from squatting (hip injury)... But DOMs feels so much more severe... Any other factors I'm not thinking of? (Obviously not leaving a ~3 month gap in my training would have made the DOMS a lot less severe lol )

For context: for the first session back I gradually eased up to very sub-maximal weights (2pl for 4 sets of 5-6). Lifts felt very easy, bar a little stiffness as i started warming up, it felt to me in the moment like I took it very slow and didn't push myself too hard. Bar moved fine. 

Context if it's relevant: M/34/5'2''/73kg; forever intermediate; 2024 5rms OHP/DL/SQ: 80/150/145kg ; program in 2024 was modified 448 run 3-4x/week. Some hip issues meant this is not the first time I've re-started squat, but never felt doms like this.",1,0.7992

Joined a new gym recently where they made me do this test. Upon seeing the result the trainer told that you dont eat enough and dont drink water enough but on the contrary I have a good decent appetite and eat more than average (taking the average of people around me). 

My gym journey : 
- Was super skinny at 176-177 cm height and weight was around 51-52 kg when I started in December
- Now height is same and weight is around 58kg. Do not look as skinny as I started before but still long way to go. 
- Supplements taken - Protein and Creatine

Does my BIA test result normal or are they in any form concerning. If so then any sort of help or advice is welcomed.

My bf tries to go to the gym 6-7 days a week. He‘ll often be there between 2-3 hours, sometimes longer. He will do functional strength exercises like Turkish get ups, and lifts with 40kg+ kettlebells, plus pull ups and deadlifts/squats. He also does about 30 minute warm up, 20 minutes of HIIT and then 30 minute treadmill walk at 15 incline. He currently also has mobility and strengthening exercises for a back injury. 

He doesn’t enjoy rest days, and thinks of any time off as him losing progress… so say a week on holiday, he will come back and step on the scale and either complain about losing weight, or if he’s the same weight as before, about gaining fat. 

He doesn’t track calories and quite honestly doesn’t eat amazingly, he says he’s either too busy to make things and doesn’t eat enough, refuses to meal prep for convenience and also won’t take protein supplements because they’re not exactly nice. And then we’ll get doughnuts, and he’ll eat 3 in one sitting. Whereas I go out of my way to eat protein bars or mix protein into my Greek yoghurt as a snack, and will eat a couple bites of a sweet treat. 

He has been complaining a lot about getting „fat“, although in my opinion his composition hasn’t changed much at all. He weighs himself multiple times a da, with clothes on, then naked, then after a meal, then when he’s dehydrated and gets upset any time there’s significant change.

My post seemed to get auto-filtered, for breaking Rule #0, but I've read the rules, have done a search here and on the Wiki, and on the wider web and haven't found an answer, so here I am!

**How reputable is the YMCA Personal Trainer Certification? (Canada)**

I'm thinking about joining the Y and a trainer whose bio is ""\[\_\] *is a certified Personal Trainer with over 6 years of experience, combining martial arts and fitness expertise to help clients reach their goals.*

*Certified by the YMCA, he creates dynamic programs focused on strength, performance, and overall health. When not training, Sam practices martial arts and calisthenics, inspiring others to live active, healthy lifestyles.*""

I think in other countries there are nationally-recognised certifications, but maybe that's not the case in Canada?

Just comparing a couple of the first ones that come up, apparently it's a 40 hr course, the same as for CFES, vs 27 from CanFitPro. Then again, CSEP is only open to people who have studied 2+ years of Kinesiology or similar, so sounds a lot more stringent!

How reputable/meaningful are these various certifications? What should I be looking for in a trainer?

A little bit of my story, 2-3 years ago, I injured my shoulder and back because of my workout, so i stopped since then (I was going to the gym 4days a week for about a year at that time). Eventually my left arm is weaker than my right arm.

Eventually I feel better so I come back to the gym.

Starting with DB shoulder press (20lbs 6 weeks ago and 30lbs each side today). I tried 30lbs at my set 3, 4, 5, 7 reps each set.

For inclined DB, (15lbs 6weeks ago), 25lbs last week for 5x7.

Leg, i did squats, 5x6 (25lbs 6 weeks ago, 40lbs last week - tried 45lbs for one set - 5 reps, but too heavy so I back to 40lbs per side).

For the back, i forgot to track down the number but generally I just want to increase the number for pull up.

I know how to use most machines, follow etiquette, and do measurements for anything that needs to be calculated or measured. 

**Plan**

See image at [https://imgur.com/a/lVzNuTU](https://imgur.com/a/lVzNuTU)

Plan notes: I only added the exercises I'm familiar with. Should I add more so that I have more to do each day in the gym? There's many curls, squats, lunges, and cables I saw online from reading exercise lists that I've never done before, but I'm hesistant to sprinkle them in without knowing their utility.  

**Goals**

Broad goals: Improve strength for racket sports, get abs. Besides getting abs, I don't care about muscle appearance at all; function over form. Besides strength, I've got other racquet athletic aspects - reaction time, hand eye coordination, speed - covered.  

Muscle based goals: For upper body, stronger shoulders, arms, and back. For lower body, more explosive power from squats. For arms, I need to improve everything: biceps, triceps, lats.

Progression plan: I don't have specific numbers in mind. However, I want to reach my goals at as fast as possible without using (steroids, protein powder, special supplements), and without risking injury from overexertion. If this requires 1-1.5 hours in the gym for 6 days a week, I can do it. If this requires good sleep and nutrition, I've got that covered. If this requires targeted nutrition, then I'd like to know what specifically besides increasing protein.  



Let me know if I should include anything else to get more specific and useful responses",2,0.9916

My weight loss journey

Hi my story in this struggle 
2017 17yrs old i lost in 7 months from 156 kg to 86kg  with a  fat burner 
There comes plan B firm up loose skin
In this stage i struggled since my coach has been moved from my branch to a bigger one however the plan was to try muscle building i was just doing what im told I didn’t understand a thing about how anything works he gave me diet i follow from a to b a plan i follow from a to b but since he moved and lost contact I tried going to other coaches in branch they really  ignored me since my gym really worked on the principal of pt however that amazing coach that trained me really did it out of sympathy of a young kid overweight i lost interest I stopped going daily rest days to gym i once fainted on the gym for working out for 3 hrs and barley ate a thing   Then goes the years at 2023  i was 194 kg had to due gastric sleeve surgery  known im 130 kg, today im trying to learn and understand how to fix my situation by my self witha little help i have a online pt and he have me the following plan 
Day 1 chest,back,abs  includes 
Barbell bench press- single arm cable row -crunches isometric single arm cable push single arm bent over dumbel row bird dog with dowel -rope fave pull-flat chest flyes -cable woodchop 

Day 2 legs & shoulders 
Isometric squat-single arm standing shoulder press with rotation-plank static -step up -lateral raises isometric reverse crunches -legg press rear delt dbls cable woodchop hight to low
 Day 3 rest 
Day 4  biceps ,triceps,abs 
Biceps curl bb 
Cable triceps push down with stright bar 
Crunches isometric- dumble biceps curl 
Laying triceps extension 
Cable woodchop 
Hammer curl 
Rope pushdown triceps 
Wall  hamstring birdge  

The thing is 70-80 % of those seems advanced lvl and i told him these are advanced im afraid i wont be able to do them correctly etc and really some of the videos he put with each exercise barely explains it a generic yt video showing the move and 2-3 in each day is one of his own videos 
These exercises where of a meeting he asked me of my goal told him simply focusing on loose skin and losing weight

Newbie here trying to make a diet which goes well with my gym goals.
I've managed to build a diet which would get me my protein and carb goals, however I have two minor concerns.
1. Is 80g of sugar a day too much? None of this is processed (it comes from an apple/banana, milk, pasta sauce etc). While I know the 30g limit is only regarding added/processed sugars (not sure what to call it, but from chocolate and stuff), im not sure if 80g is too high.
2. Is 97g of fat a day too much? 0g is transfats, 27g saturated fats. Im more sure that this is fine however most places I've seen recommend a 60/20/20 split for carb/protein/fat, this would be around 30/35.
Thanks in advance",1,0.9498

Doubt this is really a simple question, but knowing reddit, I'll get banned if i make a legit post.

TLDR, Inner butt pain around the tailbone when doing certain exercises. 23 yo, Microdisectomy patient, 12 weeks post surgery. doc and PT say its unrelated.

This post will probably get lost, so if anyone knows of a subreddit besides r/backpain or  r/sciatica where i can ask a specific PT related issue that would be more than helpful.

I often get a sharp pain in the center of my inner glutes, slightly lower than the tailbone. This occurs sometimes when i do bridges and clamshells (10% of my reps). Although now, I am able to replicate it consistently when laying on my side and stick my butt out by tilting my hips. Its not an exaggerated movement either, and my back stays flat. It's very painful, 5-7 on the pain scale. I dont get it when i sit. It doesnt shoot or travel like sciatica, it stays isolated to my inner butt for less than a second. It also doesnt burn or cause numbess, so i dont think its nerve related, but im just guessing. When my hips return to neutral it also pulls and pinches really bad.

I had a microdisectomy 12 weeks ago. I first noticed this pain 2 weeks ago when i finally started PT.
My surgeon says it is likely unrelated, and my PT doesnt know what it is. I thought maybe someone here might know what im going through since this subreddit is so big.

Anyone have ideas on what it could be? Thank you!",0,-0.9805

1jh2x95,mj5y8qc,FarhadTowfiq,2025-03-22 16:14:13,"Went to the gym on the dreaded January 1st. I knew it was gonna be crowded (which it was) but I couldn't skip leg day. Eventually I wanted to use the hip adduction/abduction machine. I saw someone's stuff (bag, water bottle, tripod) was sitting on it reserving it. I decide to just play it casual and do some other exercises before going over to it. I did 4 sets of 3 other exercises all while keeping an eye on the machine and no one once used it, just people passing by it trying to figure out who was on it. After the 3 other exercises, I ran out of exercises to do and even did my final exercise (abs) to try and buy extra time for this person. After hitting abs, I was actually pretty upset about someone reserving the single hip adduction machine in the entire gym for well over 15 minutes without even using it once. So I say screw it, I go over to the machine, ask the people to the left if they knew who's stuff it was, asked the people on the right, neither of them knew who it belonged to. Now I'm just straight up mad, someone reserving a machine on the busiest day of the year is a new level of selfish I've never seen in the gym. So I just grabbed the stuff that was sitting on the seat, put it behind the machine, and started my exercise. Wouldn't you know it, halfway through my first set, the girl who the stuff belongs to, came up and silently started grabbing her stuff and storms off out of the gym.

I don't like the idea of being that jerk in the gym that takes other people's equipment, even though I hate when people reserve equipment they're not using, I generally try to be respectful of everyone, staying out of mirror space, courteous of others but this was just ridiculous. Once I was finished, another person immediately came to use the machine, showing that multiple people were waiting for this girl to move her stuff.",59,-0.8759

It's a small gym and the deadlift area is where I do my bent over rows but that was occupied so I just used a bench as a rack and used another barbell to do my work(gotta do what you gotta do).

I warm up, then go to get more plates and in that 1 minute, this woman came and took the barbell and starts setting up for hip thrusts. I am pissed at this point already but coincidentally the deadlift area cleared up so I was like ""Okay  ma'am, you do your exercise"".

I load up a barbell, again, do one set, leave for a minute to go get the 5Kg plates and load up the first plate and I realised that I forgot to get the spring lock for the plates.
I go to get the locks and I come back to see that this bitch has taken my other plate!!!And she has another different, more spread out 5Kg plate on the other end.


I am livid at this point. Bent over rows is something I enjoy doing but it also requires a lot of focus and uninterrupted sets. It was almost 10 mins since my warm up now and I had done only 1 working set. I didn't wanna argue with a woman double my age and look like a dick  So I then again go find another set of plates, do my remaining sets but it just didn't feel right. My mood was fucking gone.

Basically I’m the most fit I’ve ever been in my life. Never realized how quickly I could see gains. People are noticing, my clothes don’t fit, etc etc. All crazy positive. 

HOWEVER, I’m tired ALL the time. I do workout early in the morning (I have 4 kids - I’m 37 yo side note - so I want to be there when they get up and in the evening after work). So I get to the gym at 4:30am. I work out M, T, Th, F, S, resting Wed and Sun. I shoot for anywhere between 3500 and 5k calories and at least 170g of protein every day. I hit the minimum most days (might miss that once a week). My wife cooks very healthy food. 
I drink pre-workout, then some coffee after the gym. Sometimes coffee around noon too. Just can’t keep energy after around 11:00am. Get to bed between 9:30 and 10:30 every night. 
Might not be a good answer without getting seen by someone but just thought I’d throw this out there to see if anyone has any ideas. 
One other thing, I went from working a tough manual labor job to a very easy (physically) desk job last year. I’m wondering if the lack of physical activity (after the gym) is what is causing a lot of this. I’m going to try to take walks and just get some more activity in when I start to feel it throughout the day. Trying to keep up my water intake as well as I’m taking creatine. 
Anyway, really long I know and probably a thousand things could be causing this but let me know if anyone has any thoughts! Thanks.",3,0.9137

Context: I used to lift actively and more stringently watched my diet a few years ago - I've since neglected both and am looking to get back into it. I'm nowhere near an advanced lifter, but not a complete beginner either. There was a time where I had easy access to a proper gym and followed a PPL pretty intently. The program had plenty of barbell, dumbbell, and cable workouts among other things (cardio, core, vanity stuff). Since then, my life circumstance has changed quite a bit and I no longer have access to a barbell or a cable machine.

I do however have access to the three items listed in that link: adjustable set of dumbbells that go up to 80lb, a nice bench (REP AB-3000), and a pull-up bar. Obviously I won't be breaking any records when the max weight is 160lb, but can I get decently far with just these and following that linked program from the wiki?",1,0.5399

1jesoib,mio98eg,Cal_Invite,2025-03-19 19:41:44,"I have a few questions, I was going to the gym pretty regularly with a trainer about 3 years ago. I had 2 kids since then and decided things have calmed down and I can make more time to go back. I recently moved, and my apartment community has free access to a College gym. I went for a tour yesterday, and I was kind of overwhelmed with all of the equipment and over stimulation. I remember the trainer I had for a month a few years ago showed me a push/pull/leg routine. I got use to the equipment at AnytimeFitness, and seeing all of these newer stuff is really starting to confuse me. I know some of the machines (not always the names), but I know what they do. My question is, how do I get better at the names of the machines? I checked out the Wiki's but when people post workout routines, I have little to no idea of what the heck they are talking about. 

  
This gym has a lot of machines like chest presses, shoulder presses, the whole 9 yards. I don't want to look like a moron, but I have been pushing myself to get past the gym fear and just show up and do something. We have a small gym in the complex, but its limited to equipment and space. But I just keep telling myself go and do something at the minimum. Any advice is welcomed, thank you.",1,0.7548

There is a head that only has the function of bending the knee, so will it be necessary to add a leg curl or is it OK if I don't hit it?",1,-0.7668

Long version: Arms are lagging and my work schedule had me move my workouts around. I was originally doing back and biceps with some triceps on Tuesday and chest and triceps with some biceps on Thursday, keeping 48 hours between them.

 With work I'm limited on the amount of time I can spend at the gym during week days so I can't really throw in an extra muscle group anymore, I barely finish out the regular routine before I have to leave.

I figured instead of Tuesday and Thursday I could throw Wednesday in as well with the following routine:

Tuesday: Back and biceps

Wednesday: Chest (and maybe triceps?)

Thursday: Biceps and triceps with some legs to close out the last 10 or so minutes just because I'm already there if I don't have to leave right away.

Deadlifting has always been my strongest and best compound lift.  My form was always on point and I could rep 450+ lbs multi sets about a decade ago.  I picked up powerlifting again back in October, benefitted from the linear gains, and everything was progressing well outside of a touch of Tennis Elbow.  I've scaled back from a 6 day PPL week to just the first 3 days per week because of work obligations.  The form on my deadlifts on my last two pull days has been horrendous.  I progress through all my cues, including the one about pushing my heels through the floor, but now I'm really just pulling the weight up with my back and with zero hamstring engagement.  Consequently, my lower back stiffens uo like crazy. 

I can't explain what's going on.  I'm not lifting more weight.  I haven't suffered an injury.  I'm going to be 49 years old in a couple of months.  Maybe I've lost too much mobility?  Anyone go through something similar?",1,0.973

Someone put the weight back in where I had it for me after they worked in the machine I was using and I was very confused.

I did resistance training as a teen, and cycled for cardio. As an adult I did around 4 months of hot yoga, but that’s been it. 

I’m relatively small, 158cm and weigh 56 (fluctuating -0.5 to + 2kgs). And body scale scans (while I know aren’t super reliable) put me around 21-23% body fat when weighed first thing in the morning after using the bathroom. 

I have just started reformer Pilates 3-4x week, and have been hitting consistent 10k steps a day. My protein target is between 100-120 and I find on most days that I am hitting that alongside 30-35% calories from fat and 30-35 calories from carbs. When I track my calories I aim for 1350-1400 on days I’m not exercising and 1450-1500 (the goal is to reverse diet and eventually be at what I see is supposed to be a normal maintenance but I’m also small so I’m not even sure what maintenance could look like). My macros usually end up being 30’s/30’s/30’s, disregarding a day a week where I might have a social engagement). I drink maybe 1 x times a week, and will have 1-2 beverages max.

So while there’s nothing wrong with my current physique and my baseline fitness is surprisingly good considering I would have said I was living a more sedentary life, I’m really struggling with wanting to have lower body fat, and what to do to achieve this. I’m told consistency, and I’ve been in my current routine for just over 2 months, but if anything the scales seem to be going up, and my clothes are fitting tighter. So I’m struggling to stay positive about my body image and to trust the process.

1jazla8,mhqtpvo,Peckish_Dumpling,2025-03-14 13:31:46,"Hello, 6’8” 27M here. I’ve lost a lot of weight before in the past (about 150lbs) and then yo-yo’d back up and over by 50lbs when COVID hit. Now I’m on part two of my weight loss journey and I’m trying to do it “right” this time. Last time, I dieted and ran the piss out of myself which- while it felt great, obviously didn’t help in the long run. So this time I’m planning on actually lifting things up and putting them down.

My legs are MASSIVE and almost bit disproportionate compared to my upper body (because I’ve been morbidly obese for a good chunk of my life) and so I’d like to focus on my upper body a bit more.(this does not mean that I’m going to stop leg day) 

This is probably a bit silly, but how long will it be before I LOOK like I lift weights regularly? You know, like how female fitness influencers go to the gym for like, 3-5 months and now they have a new butt? When will I get that but for my chest/arms/back?",3,0.9496

My goals are to continue to lift heavy things for health and remain consistent with progressive overload. I’m not body building or prepping for anything other than a long and healthy life. 

I hate squats and bench press. Lol
Is there anything wrong with keeping my program the same but changing the lifts to different forms? Example - swap barbell bench to dumbbell bench. Back squat to a hack squat. 

My thought is, this will continue to keep my consistent because it fits into my current lifestyle and time requirements. But it’s switching it up some how… I won’t have the constant noise in my head about dying if I fail during a bench press lol, in turn increasing my enjoyment :)

1jazla8,mhqbyod,DuckSwapper,2025-03-14 11:37:01,"Been running for 10+ years now, experimenting with different schedules, volume etc. along the way, and with various other sports alongside running. My latest race was a 4:33 marathon in November, however in the past two moths I started a gym routine at home too cause I grew really dissatisfied with the discrepancy between my upper vs. lower body strength over the years and decided to do something about it. The thing is, I'm having problems fitting it all with my schedule.

The sweet spot for me has always been 4 workouts a week. Experimented with 5 when I added rowing, also did 5 runs a week during marathon training etc. but still, for the most part, I felt the best energy levels-wise with 4. The thing is, when I want to add the gym, I have troubles making it all work.

Right now, I'm doing 3 runs a week (usually 2x1h and one long run \~1h45min) and 2 upper body workout using my gym equipment (pull-up bar, resistance bands, gymnastics rings; around 1h each including all the pauses between sets). This is quite taxing on me though, I have real trouble to get back to 100% energy on workout days to enjoy other things in my life (usually only succeed somewhere in the evening), I feel the tiredness carrying on to rest days etc. So I thought something must change.

What would you do? I have four main ideas:

1. Dropping to 2x run + 2x gym -> seems the easiest to implement but I don't want my running to suffer as I still consider it my favourite sport.

2. Dropping to 3x run + 1x gym -> running shouldn't suffer but the gym twice a week already is not a lot (and it's not obvious how long I'll be able to progress this way for) and here we're halving this which is not good either :(

3. Alternating 4- and 5-workout weeks -> every other week there's two runs instead of three so hopefully it wouldn't hurt as much as just scrapping one run altogether yet still adds more rest when you zoom out

4. Keeping 5 workouts a week but dropping running volume -> we still keep 3 runs a week but instead of them being 60, 60, 105min, I do something like 45, 45, 70. The volume drops significantly, yet the frequency does not. This has the added benefit that if I do adapt to the 5 days schedule in the future after the gym stops being so new for me, one of those could potentially become hills/threshold/tempo/intervals or I could just make them longer again.

Which would you choose? Or maybe something else altogether? I just wouldn't want to sacrifice too much or lose contact with medium-to-long distances or to slow down my gym progress even further, yet I see that the current schedule is unsustainable when I want to do other things in my life and enjoy them with some energy.",1,0.9882

plug your weight and height into a TDEE calculator and use that as a starting point to guess where your maintenance calories are, you might need to adjust up or down a bit from there depending on how your weight moves. 

As a new lifter you can build muscle whilst losing weight, I reckon you could do a cut for 8-10 weeks with a goal to lose 1lb/week, build some definition at the same time, and at the end be in a good position to decide if you want to do a lean bulk immediately or just maintain over beach season and do a bulk into winter.

5x5 is a great beginner routine but stops working (and imo becomes harmful) once your newbie gains max out and you're not putting weight on the bar every week or so. Once you start plateauing in 5x5 start looking around for an intermediate routine like gzclp, wendler 531, something off stronger-by-science or some other intermediate routine from a reputable source.",2,0.8151

I got into working out two months ago and I do see some changes here and there, but I'm afraid I'm not really doing things in the most optimal way possible, and I'd love to hear you guys' opinion on that.

I workout 5 days a week. I superset EVERYTHING and I do completely unrelated muscles in these supersets so that I'd roughly 90-120 seconds to rest between each set of, say, bench presses. I train roughly 2 muscle groups per day. My plan is as follows:  
Day 1: Chest + Legs  
Day 2: Shoulders + Arms  
Day 3: Chest + Legs  
Day 4: Back + Abs  
Every week, I switch day 2 and day 4, and on day 5, I repeat day 2 and work both arms and abs as well as either back or shoulders. I take most my sets to failure and I end up doing roughly 9-12 sets per muscle group per workout. I focus on compound exercises like flat and incline bench presses, squats, shoulder presses, and pullups. 

I have been told it's bad to train big muscles like legs and chest on the same day, as that would lead to fatigue. I stopped experiencing fatigue after the first 2 weeks of working out, even though I push most of my sets to failure and make sure I use weights that are heavy enough to keep have me fail on the 8th-12th rep. Am I doing things right? Do I need to switch it up? Strength wise, I think I'm seeing results (I went from curling 20lbs to 55lbs), and I do see more definition in my chest and bigger biceps but I'm not sure if I should be expecting more, or if I can optimize my workout better. I really like supersetting as it saves me a lot of time and allows me to do a lot more volume + gives me the time to rest my target muscles and jump back into my set having regained almost all my strength. My goals are to both build muscle and get stronger. Maybe a slightly bigger focus on the building muscle bit.",2,0.9805

The last one, I passed with flying colours, but as this was the first time I’ve done something like this, I made the mistake of overtraining and was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis in my left foot. Conservative treatment, stretches, ibuprofen gel sorted it out. 

Now, after a ligament injury in my right ankle which rendered me unable to walk for three weeks, the plantar fasciitis has flared up again, and this time it is more severe, before the first fitness test, I was running 3k or doing 20 minutes of interval running a day or doing and performing mock tests every four days or so. 

Now, I struggle to run 2/3rds of a kilometre on a treadmill without pain. My GP has referred me to a podiatrist in which I’m still waiting to hear from, but in the meantime I’ve been using an exercise bike in my gym for 10-15 minutes every day or two, bar weekends when I actually I have to perform. I use the tempo of the music to alter the resistance and power output to give the workout an “interval” feel.

My question is, is this type of interval cycling, or cycling at all, an adequate replacement for interval running, or running at all?

I recently came across Pavel Tsatsouline's approach of using 30-50% of your 10RM as a way to build strength and performance. This contrasts with the traditional progressive overload method, where you push sets closer to failure before increasing weight. I'm hesitant to overhaul my entire program, so I’m considering testing it on just one exercise—Incline Bench—as part of my Upper B day (I run an u/L split, one day on, one day off, with rep ranges in the 5-8 range).

Would applying this method to Incline Bench once per week (3 sets) be enough volume to see results? How do you determine when to increase the load? Are there any nuances I should be aware of before giving it a shot?

1j8mgdo,mh6ws8q,juliusss04,2025-03-11 12:26:18,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been following Reddit’s Metallicadpa PPL consistently since early January 2025. Before that, I trained, but very inconsistently and without properly tracking reps, sets, or weights. Back in 2021-2022 (when I was around 17-18), I was more consistent with training and also went through a major fat loss phase, dropping from 209 lbs (95 kg) to 158 lbs (72 kg) between 2020 and 2022.

The problem was, I ended up very skinny (maybe skinny-fat?), and I wasn’t happy with how I looked or my lifts. My training suffered as a result. Fast forward to now—I’m 20 years old, 180 cm (5'11"") tall, and currently weigh 76 kg (167 lbs). I’ve been in a fat loss phase for the past 3 months, religiously tracking my diet and only eating ""clean."" My average intake is around 2000 kcal (+/- 100). Despite eating relatively little, my strength has gone up more than it did in my past training phases, though nothing spectacular.

I’ve started to see my abs (about a 4-pack) in good lighting and when I flex, but I want them to be more visible, so I’m still in a deficit for now. However, I struggle a lot with self-criticism and constantly doubt whether I’m doing enough or making the right choices.

I walk 8-10k steps daily and have also cut out a lot of bad habits and I really want to take my training to the next level and see better results, but I feel a bit lost in terms of progression, diet, and overall direction.

Would love to hear any advice from those who’ve been in a similar situation! Should I continue cutting?",2,-0.8726

I haven't been going for very long (about a month) but used to work out a lot between 16-20 and a little in my mid-30s.  I mostly did trade work and field work in my 20s and 30s but now in mid 40s, am office-bound, 2 young kids and slower metabolism and trying to get back into it - harder than it was before in some respects but easier in others.  I'm currently in a ""body recomposition"" mode and trying to lose BF down to 15-20%, currently I'd estimate I'm at 20-25% with my love handles being a big reason for that estimation.    
  
In terms of kit, I have a home gym with power rack, couple of barbells, ezy curl bar, decent bench with leg attachment (and preacher attachment coming), several kettlebells, cheapo cable kit, treadmill and c2 rowerg.    

Stats are: Male, 43, 1.75m (5'9""), 93ish kg (about 200lbs), lift numbers on routine sheet, and they're not too high yet but they're steadily increasing per workout - up 2.5% on UB and 5% on LB per pass.  Only repeated weights twice (bench) when I got stuck on 57kg, but soon when through it.  Usually do weights Monday, Wednesday, Friday and rowing or walking on the Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.  I walk the dog on the beach and swim with my daughter on the Saturday but it's not strenuous.  Just came in from my longest row, an hour in Z2 and first time over 10K.

I try to do either 5x5 on each compound exercise and 5x10 on isolated ones - seems to work for me.  I do fewer Deadlift sets (3x5) with only one full weight set. Am watching what I eat, and keeping my diet at about 2100cal (8800kJ) with 35P:25F:45C macros.  Somedays are better than others but never usually go over the amount.  Am using protein shakes to supplement when needed.  I also do IF 17:7 which resticts my time for going over on the calories.  

Planning to increase to PPLUL eventually but want to get through this newb-beginner phase first - and I may also struggle with my setup and machine choices or lack thereof.  I'd also like to incorporate a bit more plyo into my workouts so I can be a bit more functionally fit, and also including more kettlebell swings/tgus and cardio for joint, stability and heart health too.  Want to try and be there for the kids and keep up with them, something my Dad was never able to do with me (he was 41 when I was born, same as I was when my youngest was born, and he struggled with mobility and heart issues throughout my childhood, exaserbated by alcohol and a motorbike injury, and lack of rehab, when in his 20s).  

Initial plan was from a Buff Dudes beginner workout (from YT, not their ""12 week plan"" pdf which seemed weirdly laid out) and I've added some more isolation exercises in there to keep it interesting - the Stronglifts 5x5 would probably send me nuts within a few weeks and this is keeping me interested even if it's a good beginner program.  I still am able to put on muscle pretty quickly and some things are getting tight in the chest but looser in the belly.  I've already got a much stronger knees (was having a problem with some stability before I began - and was a driver for getting fitter) and back, arms and chest.  I feel lighter, but am a similar weight to how I started, and importantly, my kids feel lighter too when picking them up. I'm also trying to be careful not to overtrain certain muscle groups too - the initial aches and pains have dissipated (triceps took longer than expected).  Not trying to break records, compete or anything, just look good, feel healthy, eat mostly normally and be functionally strong and fit.

Would really love some feedback as I'm kinda going at this alone following a fair bit of reading, program comparing and memory from programs I used to use in the 90s/00s.

Thanks in advance. Sorry for the diatribe.",1,0.9903

Hi!!! I’m a 5’1” 23F and weighs 52.5kg. And I’ve been wanting to put together a 5-day workout split but I’m a bit lost and could use some advice on balancing swimming, Pilates, and strength training to lose a bit of weight and get that lean, toned look without bulking too much.

A little background:
- I tried weightlifting before, but my upper body bulks up easily, and I didn’t love how my arms looked bigger or how I felt bloated/inflamed most of the time.

- However, I did like how my glutes grew and became more toned. I naturally have bigger thighs, so I don’t want to add too much size there.

- I enjoy swimming and was thinking of using it as my main cardio since I don’t love running.

- My mom got into Pilates a few months ago and recently bought a reformer. I noticed how her core/abs looked way more sculpted than mine ever did with weight training, and her arms leaned out and toned up instead of bulking—we have almost the same body type/shape, so that made me want to try it too!

Since I can work out five times a week, how should I structure my split to balance all three while leaning out, toning up, and keeping muscle definition? Should I focus more on Pilates and swimming for my upper body and just do targeted strength training for glutes?

Also, if anyone has good YouTube recommendations for reformer Pilates, I’d love to hear them!

Would appreciate any advice or personal experiences—thanks in advance! 😊",3,0.9936

- Face pulls
- Leg raises / other abs exercise?
- If time: calf raises

How do I properly fail a squat? I always set up safety bars when using heavy loads, but I don't really understand how they should be used. I set them such that they never touch the barbell when I'm in my lowest position, but my lowest position is a bit below parallel, like I actually squat as down as I possibly can (is this wrong?). This means that if I were to actually fail, I couldn't go deeper than that to allow the barbell to rest on the bars. So should I drop it? If yes, how? Should I fall back myself instead?

Question is without gear, on average 1–2 lbs of muscle can be gained per month. But I always see gym goers always say ""if you wanna be big, eat big"", sure makes sense. But bulking will also gain fat too? I understand there is clean bulking, but so many gym goers are like ""I have to be in a caloric surplus to gain muscle"" but doesn't this counter the science between, let's say the average of 1–2 lbs of muscle per month? Let's say my diet and gym routine caps me out at 1lbs of muscle per month, eating in a caloric surplus will just make me..... fat and muscle gain is not gonna increase cause... science?

So, my ultimate question is...... why eat all the calories when clean bulking seems to be a better choice? It seems that clean bulking will focus on muscle building, less fat gain and one can maintain their body fat %........

Hello, I (5’8, 141lbs, 24M) have been doing a Dumbell only bulking routine for about 11 weeks, with some heavy mods as time went on. They’re pretty finnicky and take so long to adjust but they’re all I got so. 🤷🏿‍♂️

Not going for a crazy surplus, a smaller one between 100-300 is fine for me.

Some of my lifts are regressing since like 3-4 weeks ago, and I’ve been feeling more fatigued and achy lately. I got sick a while ago (Other folks in the house were sick) and had to delay my workout by two days, then just pushed into it the following day.

I’m also just sick of eating so much, it takes up so much time in my day to plan it out especially with my schedule, especially having to eat healthy stuff which you need to eat TONS of, and I’d be satisfied just having to eat once and maybe a few snacks here and there. Instead of two 1-1.4k calorie meals. It’s kinda fun, but so time consuming!

I’m considering a full week off, just to see if it helps me. After tomorrow’s workout.

Should I continue to eat at a calorie surplus (Aiming for a slight one, about 100-300 above maintenance) during my break? Or taper back to maintenance since I’m not working out. I still plan on getting my steps in, eating healthy, perhaps either walking with a weighted vest (Like I have during my routine on 2/4 rest days) or even a 36-40hr fast just to see how it makes me feel.

Also any tips on how to ease into the week off, then ease back into working out. I feel like in the back of my mind I’m just being lazy. Should I eat surplus for 38 hours after my last workout to support MPS then go into maintenance/deficit/just eating when I’m hungry? I eat so much fiber and protein I haven’t felt real hunger in a long time.

The routine, **general feedback welcome** but I may have to clarify a few things. Sets and reps for example are the minimum.

I’m a former athlete trying to get back into shape, three months back into exercising. I’m 44, overweight, still relatively strong. While I’m  deconditioned, my resting heart rate is better than average at 67.

I’m doing a mix of gym cardio, strength training and running. Running always feels anaerobic. Week 3 of couch to 5k is a struggle.

But when I lift it elevates my heart rate and then I can do elliptical at 155+ bpm basically indefinitely. I sweat, I’m tired, but my breath isn’t ragged. My perceived exertion is not matching my bpm. And I’ve googled this situation, and the results usually are for people with very high resting heart rates because of being so deconditioned.

It feels stupid to ask, but is this just what aerobic activity feels like? I’ve always been big (not just overweight, I’m built like an O lineman) so running always felt quite difficult. Should I up the intensity? Or is it fine to focus on 45 minute sessions keeping my heart in this ~155 zone?

I used to be extremely consistent with training over a long period of time. I'd say I went 12 year straight with almost never going to the gym less than 3 times a week. And then as life got busy (work and kids) I ended up having an abrupt 2 year period where I completely stopped.

I've started up again recently. I'm still fairly muscular but of course not what I used to be. I'm now 4 weeks straight in. I am eating a 700 calorie deficit and also started taking 5mg of creatine per day.

The annoying part is that I'm gaining about 1 lb per week still. Yes, I know its the creatine and likely building some muscle. I really don't care that I'm gaining numbers on the scale, its more that I'd like to use weight as a metric to optimize and tweak my diet.

My question is, when can I expect a plateau effect from the creatine and the muscle building re-start? I kind of expected 4 weeks to be that point.",2,0.9009

I go to the gym 7x a week (Thursday is supposed to be a rest day but I do cardio and sometimes do abs) and also do 45 minutes of cardio on the treadmill at a 16% incline and 3.5km/h. I also drink bare minimum 3.5L of water everyday and I've been on creatine since February 3rd, if that's relevant.

What I'm wondering the most is if my protein intake is fine or if I should change it. I'm also fresh off a lean bulk.

I do 3 sets for exercises, 6-12 reps. 


Day 1

Bench press / Incline bench press

Pull up / Cable row

Trap bar deadlift / Hack squat

Cable hammer curl 

Tricep push down

Chest supported dumbbell lateral raise 

Deadhang



Day 2

Bench press / Incline bench press

Pull up / Cable row

Trap bar deadlift / Hack squat

Cable Tricep extension 

Leg raise

Face pull 

Plate pinch hold



Day 3

Bench press / Incline bench press

Pull up / Cable row

Trap bar deadlift / Hack squat

Cable Lateral raise 

EZ bar bicep curl

Cable ab crunch

Shoulder press (machine/dumbbell)



Exercise count per week:
Chest x3
Back x3
Leg x3
Bicep x2
Tricep x2
Core x2
Side delt x2
Rear delt x1
Front delt x1
Forearm x2

My goal is strength + aesthetics. Maybe leaning a bit more towards strength.

How would you comment on this workout routine?

I mainly have these questions:
1. I only do two types of exercises for chest, back and leg, will that be enough or will it result in some sort of muscle imbalances?
2. I heard that hack squat and trap bar deadlift both targets more quads. Will my hamstring be underdeveloped? 
3. Are there any types of functional muscle groups I am ignoring?

[Research shows](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51113664_Effect_of_Two_Different_Weight-Loss_Rates_on_Body_Composition_and_Strength_and_Power-Related_Performance_in_Elite_Athletes) a weekly rate of body-weight loss of 0.7% can permit muscle gain in both men and women while losing fat mass. At my starting weight of 150 lbs, this is roughly 1 lb/wk. Using MacroFactor, I set my desired weekly reduction to 0.5 lb/wk to be safe, and I reached my target of 145 lbs after eight weeks, which averages out to 0.625 lbs/wk. During this time, I continued lifting twice/week and doing cardio 1-3x/week while eating 110g+ protein daily (and lingering around 2100 cals daily).

Based on my fat caliper measurements (which I know are not perfect but have been consistent), in the first month, 75% of the weight I lost was **fat mass**, whereas the second month, it looks to be **100% muscle mass**, which I'm highly dismayed to see. Overall, my BF dropped from 20.4% to 19.6%; my goal was to try and be at 15% BF by end of March, which seems highly improbable given the slow progress.

1. Looking back, what might explain the loss of muscle mass given I was eating 110g+ of protein daily, lifting heavy twice/week, and having an average weekly weight loss of 0.625 lbs?
2. Looking forward, what should I do if my primary goal is still to reach 15% BF even though I'm happy with my current weight?

My gym doesn't have any free weights besides the obvious dumbbells and a bench press/incline bench press station. I specifically chose a dumbbell program because my gym is empty when I choose to workout and I'm not comfortable doing bench press without a spotter. Not like I can do barbell squats either, although I guess deadlifts are a possibility. Then on off days I do intense cardio instead of picking a six day routine. 

Avoiding going on a tangent for too long, I just want clarification if my accessory work is beneficial or if I should substitute it for other workouts. I subbed the goblet squats for a smith machine front squat since I ran out of dumbbells to progress with. After the push day I use a chest press machine, fly machine, and shoulder press machine. On pull days, I do rows, lat pull downs, and rear delt flys. And then on leg days I do smith machine back squats, leg extensions, and leg curls. Are these all fine or should I sub them out / drop them entirely since the original program doesn't include accessory work at all? Or if there's anything else I could possibly do wrong? 

I'm reluctant to change the program too much since I don't have too much time to exercise and the original program + these accessories fit in perfectly with my schedule but if I'm doing something wrong I want to rectify it lest I get injured.

1j5k484,mgngy94,AgfaAPX100,2025-03-08 07:42:10,"Hi. I (28F) started working out again in december last year. I am doing the BWF primer from Nick-E and am really enjoying it so far.

My goals are:

\- building strength and learning skills like push up, pull up, hand stand, so the usual calisthenics stuff  
\- building muscle (not for becoming super big but rather for a healthy back, I am a pretty small and fragile person)

I have still a lot of progression to do with push ups (haven't even reached the floor yet lol), pull ups and rows. I do those at home.

But for the lower body, I need more weight which I don't have at home.

The BWF primer is a whole body work out and now I am thinking if I could split it to 2 upper body workouts at home, at 1 lower workout in the gym per week. This would mean I wouldn't have to go to the gym for every work out. Also I prefer not having sore muscles all over my body after every work out. :D

So I would do the BWF primer upper body part for strength and skills 2 x a week:

\- dead bugs  
\- bird dogs  
\- push up progression  
\- rows progression  
\- pull up progression (banded and negativ pull ups atm)

and legs in the gym once a week:

\- goblet squats  
\- leg press  
\- glute bridges  
\- RDLs  
\- calf raises  
\- maybe a machine like abduction??

Would that work? This would work best for my weekly planning so I would be okay if this wasn't the ""most oprimal"" plan. But I wanna be sure it will work.

If you have any suggestions I'd be happy to hear!",1,0.9867

32M, 6', 180lbs. Looking for genuine criticism/overall holistic advice.

I have been genuinely trying to make significant process in the gym for *years* now and I feel like I'm at a standstill/have never really put on significant muscle mass; I've looked like this since I was 18. I swim competitively with a very fast team 5x per week (almost entirely aerobic threshold sets, 4-5000y) but I'm not sure if this is just incompatible with gym gains for the amount of aerobic/anaerobic work I'm doing, or if I just need to eat an absolute ton more (I feel like I'm already eating like 3000 calories a day minimum, but admittedly not tracking macros, just trying to satiate hunger), change my split routine at the gym up (have always done body part splits M/W/F), or just otherwise change something I'm not thinking of. But I've felt like I'm at this weird crossroads between not really being lean, not really being muscular, or just feeling sort of ""average"" in every respect. I'm a fast swimmer but I would like to be more toned/have far more muscle definition. Happy to give more information if anybody has thoughts on what to change.

I can’t feel like this has stopped almost any progress though. I am less fat, yes, but almost no muscle gain. I’m following Jeff Nippard’s Fundamentals workout plan. I’d love to know of any tips or tricks to help me improve.

I've a question for those of you that are more experienced than me...
I've been training for more or less 2 years, and I've recently decided to change my split to target every group 2 times a week (I used to train everything only once till a week ago).
The Split I ""created"" is the following:
PUSH-PULL-PUSH-PULL
4 times a week, where I hit Quads in the PUSH day and femorals/calves etc in the Pull day.
In other words, It's not the classic PUSH-PULL-LEGS since I decided to blend the leg day in the other 2 days of training.
I want you to be honest with me: what do u think about it? Does it make sense? 
In my opinion it could be a good mix between a Full Body and a Push-Pull-Legs split, but I'm afraid I'm missing something. Thanks!

I understand the tiers of exercises and the progression system but I am unsure how to schedule things. I can do 3 days a week and I’d like to add a fourth day for running too. Would be Monday lift, Wed lift, Fri or Sat lift, Sat or Sunday Run. 

Some of the articles and wiki make it seem like a PPL style split while others are full body. I’d prob guess I’d do the full body

Day 2: T1 Deadlift, T2 OHP, T2a Rows, T3a biceps, T3b face pulls, t3c lat pull downs, T3d Dips

Day 3: T1 Squat, T2 Bench, rest similar to day 1

Day 4: T1 OHP, T2 Deadlift, rest similar to day 2

Basically a Chest/Legs day and a Back/Shoulders day where I prioritize the Chest and Back on days 1/2 while still working legs and shoulders and then prioritizing legs/shoulders on days 3 and 4 but still working chest and back.

I lift pretty good weights I think, for example my deadlift is 140kg, bench is 115kg and squat is 135kg. 

I know about nutrition (or pretend to) but I still can never get my body fat down. I put it down to genetics to be honest but I took up a challenge this year, to run 7 half marathons for a charity close to me. I was hoping this would help me shed some of my body fat too but I honestly feel like I’m not budging.

I sit at around 19-22% body fat.

I am Male, 31, I am 5ft 7 and I weight about 90kg

I hit these macros daily:

P: 180g
C: 180g
F: 40g

1800 cals 

I do 3 weight lifting days a week and I do 3 5k’s a week with one long run a week. 

I start at 10k, the week after it’s a 12k, the week after that it’s 14k, 16k, 18k and then I do the half marathon in the final week. It’s a 6 week cycle.

I take a week off running and then start again. Currently in my 2nd half marathon cycle and at about £300 raised so far so not too bad lol.

Is it possible I’m just not eating enough?",1,0.9823

The gym has 6 Smith machines all occupied, I see a guy putting things in his duffel bag and it looked like he was finishing up however I see a lot of dumbbells laying around. I went up to him and asked if he was finishing, he said “it’s all yours” and started to walk away. I thought he was going to get a towel to wipe the bench down so I asked if he wanted help with putting away some of the dumbbells and he chuckled and said “you got it” I replied so you’re not going to put any of the dumbbells you used away? He said “for what? You’re about to use it” I said I’m about to use the machine not the 20 dumbbells. Anyway he told me to fuck off and walked away. Bro literally had 7 sets of dumbbells and 2 ez curl bars plus plates left on the floor, didn’t wipe the bench down. I guess I could have got 9 sets of farmer carries in but decided not to and left the weights there.

I hate how chaotic I feel about my body. One moment, I look in the mirror and think I’m making progress; five minutes later, all I see is a disgusting blob.

I hate that I struggle to recognize my progress, even when I know I’m losing inches. The pants that were almost too tight around my tummy and thighs a month ago are now starting to feel loose. But instead of believing it’s because I’ve made progress, I convince myself they just stretched out in the wash.

I hate that I’m not on a weight loss journey and find myself jealous of those who are. As a 5’10”f and around 145 lbs, I don’t need to lose weight—I need to lose fat and build muscle. But it’s slow, and not as exciting or glamorous as weight loss. Nobody is going gaga over my newly developed baby biceps.

Mostly, I hate that I’m trying to do everything right—or at least consistently—but it still feels like I’m doing everything wrong.

With the influx of people, they decided to start up a HIIT class in one of the 3 main lifting areas that just so happens to have 5 of their 9 power racks.  I head in to do squats in one of the racks and one of the workers comes over to tell me nobody is allowed in this area except those who are in the class.  The class does not use the racks at all, as most exercises are bodyweight or with freeweights, so they are cutting off the available power racks by over half during peak hours and have someone standing at the door to the area like a bouncer now.

On top of that, common courtesy has taken a nose dive.  Groups of people will do supersets together on multiple pieces of equipment at once, tying up already limited resources.  People are throwing shit on benches, fucking off out of the area completely, then getting upset when you try to use their equipment that they plan on using eventually.

Please keep in mind that I procrastinate a lot, and the only way to get myself to workout consistently is to do it everyday and build momentum. If I rest for a day, it will be much harder to get back on the routine later on (I am also autistic).

Workout A:

Body-weight Rows (on gymnastic rings)

Body-weight Pushups (Feet elevated, also on gymnastic rings so I get more depth)

Squats (With 30kg vest)

Leg Raises (Hanging from a pullup bar, no weights)

Workout B:

Body-weight Pullups

Body-weight Pike-Pushups (Feet elevated for more difficulty, hands on floor because I have nothing to elevate)

Squats (as above)

Leg Raises (as above)

Progression:

I started at 25 reps for each exercise, then each week I added 5 reps, done in however many sets it took to reach the rep goal, rest time was 2 mins for everything except pullups which was 4mins.

I trained everyday, ran this program for 5 weeks and was consistent with it, only missed 2 days because of sickness.

I have worked on other programs but when the exercise selection is above 4 it just seems so complicated and I do not have the mental capacity or willpower to spend so much time working out.

I have attempted to add extra exercises to this plan but it makes me dread the workout and so I become very likely to skip it.

When it is short and sweet like this I actually enjoy working out and can be consistent with it, I even look forward to each workout which is not something I normally do.

Some problems I've been having: When I started the 2nd month with 50 reps goal, I got past the first week but then had this overwhelming and constant tiredness, the symptoms were similar to CNS fatigue from what I've read online. I have been resting for the past 2 weeks and only feel now that it has gone away and I plan to get back to working out soon. Is there something I can do to avoid this?

A few days ago I woke up late for physical therapy and needed to run out of the house, all I was able to do was drink a cup of water; I was dreading training because I knew going to training hungry meant headaches and nausea.

As I trained I stopped feeling hungry and after training, while I knew I 'needed' food soon, I was not having the vicious hunger urge -- the kind that makes you dizzy, ravenous, thirsty, upsets your stomach and gives you a headache. I eventually ate a big meal but I don't know what happened there.

I've a question for those of you that are more experienced than me...
I've been training for more or less 2 years, and I've recently decided to change my split to target every group 2 times a week (I used to train everything only once till a week ago).
The Split I ""created"" is the following:
PUSH-PULL-PUSH-PULL
4 times a week, where I hit Quads in the PUSH day and femorals/calves etc in the Pull day.
In other words, It's not the classic PUSH-PULL-LEGS since I decided to blend the leg day in the other 2 days of training.
I want you to be honest with me: what do u think about it? Does it make sense? 
In my opinion it could be a good mix between a Full Body and a Push-Pull-Legs split, but I'm afraid I'm missing something. Thanks!

How do you decide which types of equipment or routines overall? For example, rowing. I've done the rowing machine where you push back and move. I've done the rowing machine where you just pull but also lean back and legs out. I've done the rowing machine where you Sit down, and put your arms out and do it. And lastly, I've done rowing with... I forgot the name but they're bands I hold onto and use my entire body for.

Thing is, idk which is best. Or how to figure it out. Is there a way or does it depend on something? For what it's worth, I think I like the bands the most as they seem to use my core a lot (and my core is kinda shit but so important that I like doing it)

My current back squat max is 230x5. Not terrible, not great. However, my sled leg press max is 470x10, and that’s *after* squats. Obviously leg press is going to be higher, but I feel like my leg press is intermediate level while my squats are novice level. I’m not cheating the leg press either while I feel like I occasionally cheat my squats and don’t go low enough. 

I’d think that these two lifts should be pretty parallel with each other - both on the same lifting level. Any recommendations or ideas on what could be lacking with my squats? Maybe an additional lift to incorporate to increase squat strength? Here’s my current leg day routine with incremental load of 5lbs if possible. If not possible, additional rep or two. 

Back squat 5x5

RDL or SDL 8-12x3

Leg press 8-12x3

Lying leg curl 8-12x13

Personally, I just hate the setting, it's making me feel unstable, the muscle stability at the top isn't that good and generally the thing is just no fun.

  
This is interesting because I love the flat barbell press and the seated shoulder press (slight incline back on the bench) - both work for me and I feel a great pump afterwards. 

  
Do you guys think I should just hunker down, lower the weights and keep at it util the thing stops sucking, or would looking for an alternative (like chest extensions with a scooping motion) be a good idea?

* Sweet potatoes, rinsed and chopped into medium sized cubes
* Plain full fat yogurt
* Cashews (can sub with peanuts but it's not as good)
* Onion
* Garlic
* Curry powder
* Chicken stock

# Steps

1. Start simmering sweet potatoes cut into cubes. Leave the skin on if you want to get all the nutrients.
2. Saute onions until they start shrinking then add cashews and curry powder. Saute 5m more minutes until the kitchen smells like an Indian restaurant and everything is starting to brown.
3.  Add the onion/cashews a blender along with the plain yogurt. Blend until you have a thick paste. 
4. Heat some chicken stock to a simmer then stir in yogurt/onion paste. 
5. Add sweet potato cubes and stir. Some of the cubes may start falling apart but that's alright.
6. Let it simmer for 10m or so until all the flavors have time to blend. 
7. At this point you can add various umami bombs like chili crisp or fish sauce but it doesn't really need much.

I'm still fairly new to creating higher protein, lower calorie foods for my macro goals. I'm currently trying to lose fat and build muscle (aren't we all lol)


Despite being new, I've created a pizza dough recipe (and topping recipe), which I'm super happy with and wanted to share!


Total for 1 pizza


Base - 249KCal, 12.2gProtein, 1gFat, 50gCarb

Chicken tikka - 107Kcal, 22.3gProtein, 1.6gFat,  1.2gCarb

Cheese (shredded mozzarella) - 122KCal, 9.6g protein, 8.4gFat, 2.2gCarb

Sauce - 20g tomato pure, dash of soy sauce, dry basil, garlic puree - 20kcal, 0.9gProtein, 0gFat, 3.5gCarb


Total Pizza - 498kCal, 45.1gProtein, 11gFat, 58.4gCarb

(I add peppers from some freshness, adds around 20/25 extra cals)


Method -

For the dough (this makes 4 pizzas: 432g split 4 ways):


240g White Flour
30g Serving MyVegan Soy Protein Isolate Unflavoured 
15g Honey
Active dry yeast
3/4 cup warm water
Salt


- mix honey into warm water and add sache (about a teaspoon) of active dry yeast and give it a stir. Set this aside for 5 mins
- weigh your flour and protien powder and then mix these dry ingredients with a few pinches of salt together very well
- make a well in the middle and pour in your water honey yeast mixture 
- using chopsticks, I combine until a shaggy dough has formed and then turn out onto an oiled surface and kneed the dough for about 10 mins
- replace the dough into an oiled bowl and let rise for an hour or until doubled
- I then wrap lightly in clingfilm and place into an airtight container and stick into the fridge


Chicken tikka:

30g 0fat greek yoghurt 
Chilli powder
Garam Masala
Cumin powder
Corriander powder
Black pepper
Paprika 
Garlic puree
Ginger puree
75g cooked chicken breast chunks


- mix all the spices with the yoghurt 
- coat the chicken in the mix
- lay out on a sheet and grill for 5 mins or until you see the yoghurt start to char


Sauce :
20g tomato puree, dash of soy sauce, dash of olive oil, dash of dried basil, dash black pepper, pinch brown sugar, half tea spoon of garlic puree - mix all together!


Cooking:

Take dough out of the fridge (a portion size) half an hour before cooking so it's easier to work with. While that's resting, I cook my tikka, make my sauce, and preheat the oven.

I just roll out my dough with a roling pin until its around a 12inch pizza size (this is quite thin but that's what I like) - this dough isn't sticky so you shouldn't need to use any additonal flour to work with it when rolling it out.

Heat up a medium-sized pan on medium-high heat with a spray of oil and a sprinkle of salt and preheat your oven to 180 degrees celcius.

Once the pan is hot, place your rolled out dough in and start constructing the pizza (add on the sauce, toppings, then cheese)

Once the pizza has a browned base, (4-5 mins for me usually) transfer to the oven and cook for another 10-12 minutes!

I mostly target 3x8-12 sets and when I can easily do 3x12 then I increase the weight and start from 3x8. My question is, for some exercises it seems impossible to reach this point where I increase the weight. Mostly lat pulldowns, rows, or even bench press (I don't have a spotter). Or for example shoulder lateral raises, if I increase the weight from 5 to 6 kg I may not even reach 3x8 reps.

1j04aj5,mf9485p,whatThisOldThrowAway,2025-02-28 14:08:18,"###Anyone fully replaced flat bench press with dumbell press? Any routine suggestions or alternative substitutes? 

**Actual question**: 

So what have folks done (for themselves, or for their clients) when flat benching wasn't an option for whatever reason?  

Obviously we can all list bench alternatives - but really looking to hear from folks who have actual experience of having done this: What programing changes did you make; what training outcomes did you see, how did you reset expectations vis a vis PBs and such? What kind of weight/reps/sets did you prescribe relative to flat bench? 

So far I've just punted with upping my strict-press volume and dumbell pressing where it says flat bench in my program -- but no idea how that'll actually turn out in terms of training outcomes - smaller arms, smaller chest, undermining my strict press etc. Curious if anyone's experience can save me some time.

**Context/me**: 

M/35/160cm/75kgbw. Happily plateaued intermediate just maintaining/fucking about for over a year as life is happening a lot lately. 

2024 3RMs for some general context: Strict press 85, squat 140, deadlift 145, bench 100. OHP was close to an all time PB I think, the rest are down modestly from previous peaks, because I'm training them less realistically. 

I'm doing a somewhat loose but fairly typical 448 every-other-day type training cadence. 

My goal is general health, injury resiliency and to maintain, where possible, my current intermediate strength and muscle-mass levels, despite my diet being a bit up and down at times. Body-weight has been steady with periods of gradually, unintentionally gaining weight through overeating when life happens. 

**Why not just bench?** 

Long story short I've moved to a pretty ok but in ways kinda shitting commercial gym - but it's so convenient to my new place that I've decided to stick with it despite some shortcomings: The major shortcoming I haven't found a workaround for is there's no safe, typical way (for me) to barbell bench press (flat, incline, decline). 

In short: Most benches are bolted in place with some having fixed-height pins for benching - but pins are way too high for me. I'd basically need to clean the bar off the ground & lie back with it; or sit up to lift the bar off the pins. Fine for relatively trivial weights, but not workable/safe for heavy sets. They have movable benches for benching in the squat rack with adjustable pins - but the benches are way too tall - when I sit on them my feet can't reach the floor. I brought my own footrests at first (to have a setup where I could reach the pins and the floor) but they had a polite but uncompromising chat with me after the first few times I did that, basically ""look, I get it's stupid, but it's an insurance issue, please don't"" - but they also won't provide any themselves (bullshit, I know, but I'm compromising because I value how close the gym is more than I value specifically flat benching).",1,0.9768

31M/5'9''/154lbs 

Back -> https://imgur.com/PJOotzq
Front -> https://imgur.com/rNZR6a5


**History:**

* I have been lifting for years and always had disappointing results - until I finally got my nutrition in order. 
* I play a tennis (amateur) on the regular in the city's local league and hence need to spend 2-3 days doing some intense cardio. Remainder of the week, I lift.
* I am 4 weeks into my cut (1700 daily intake - my TDEE per those several online calculators was 2000) - I figured a 300 deficit would be good. 
* I am consistent and I love working out / playing sports. Calories counting has been a game changer for me - With mindful eating and protein intake, I have made more visible progress in 2 months than I did in 5 years (and I wish I was exaggerating)


**Goals:**

I do not have any aspirational bodybuilding goals  - just that I want defined and visible abs - I have never had a great shirtless physique and would like one. 


**My questions:**

* How long should I cut for? Another few weeks? Like I said, my goal is nothing but defined set of abs. So should I just continue cutting till I get abs? Is that how it works?

* Though my lifts have stayed steady, I've dropped 5 pounds in 5 weeks and I just feel *thinner* with more definition all around (including my belly). Please bear with my extremely silly question here but, say I stop my cut after a few weeks and start eating in a surplus instead, won't that mean I am undoing everything I did in the past 2 months? 

* With the progress I am making, I am confident I will have an ab outline (however dim it might be) in about 2 months. But what then? I do want to pack on more muscle and look fullter - do I just gain all the weight back with a surplus?

I started working out last month. I don’t have a routine or program, I just do what I feel like that day. I generally use the treadmill for at least 15 min, sometimes up to 45 min if I’m particularly energized. Some days I focus on my upper body (chest, lats, and back), others I focus on my legs (stair master, calf raises). For things that I can do reps on, my general routine is 3 sets of 7-10 reps depending on how strong I feel that day. 

So far I don’t do much else but essentially I try to rotate the machines I use. I am starting to feel a little stronger at least compared to when I first started. Is it necessary to have like a solid plan when I go to the gym? I wouldn’t mind creating one for myself but I’m just wondering if I’m shooting myself in the feet by not having one.",1,0.942

Went to the gym this morning and it was my day to workout on the green turf.  I do sleigh pushes, battle ropes and some work with the kettle bells. Starting off with sleigh pushes.  Gym opens at 5:30am, so that's when I started.  Now correct me if I am wrong, but the green turf is designed and dedicated for things like sleigh pushes, box jumps, etc. At least in my gym it is.  I've been doing my pushes for about 25 minutes already, when this entitled asshole come up and sits, RIGHT IN MY PATH of pushing, on one of the boxes that is up against a wall to ""stretch"".  Might I mention the turf zone is right next to the designated stretching area.  And this is also the second time this dude has done this to me.  

So I begin my next set of pushes and I get to his foot, directly in my way and have to stop because he won't move.  We end up in a verbal confrontation because he says, ""where else am I supposed to go. You can move your workout. You don't need to take up the entire turf"". I can move MY WORKOUT?!?! Wait, what?! Ummm, I'm sorry. Isn't this what the turf is for?! And why should I have to move my workout, the one I have been doing in this space for half an hour already, because you need to use it to stretch.  You can't move the box you are sitting on out of the way to the other side of the turf that no one is using?  I was alone in the space before he showed up. So I asked him if he would appreciate it if I walk through his squat rack (which he frequently uses) when he is trying to squat (and the petty side of me is saying to do that, but I won't). He didn't have much to say to that. It ended in me telling him I wasn't moving, to fuck off, and I continued my workout, damn near running his fat foot over.

What's worse is the staff member who was working was literally standing there watching the whole thing, along with 3 other people (who all came up to me afterwards and said I was justified to tell him to fuck off). The staff member came up to me after asking if I wanted to file a complaint with the manager.  Why, so he can do what? And maybe while it was happening she could've stepped in that I was only doing what the space was designed for. I just said they need to put up signs for what the turf zone is for.  

I literally cannot deal with the absolute ridiculous amount of self-entitlement there is out there now a days.  And now I am the one left to feel uncomfortable going to the one place that was supposed to be my zen (because generally I don't deal well with confrontation).",30,-0.9029

Tried browsing the faq/wiki first but didn't see anything particular about this so thought I'd ask here:

I started working out with my wife about two months ago, doing fitness classes 3-4x a week (M-upper body, W-lower body, TR-upper body, Sat-combined (typically more focus on lower body though)

Anyways, while I've noticed some marked improvement in getting over the soreness that follows a good workout (i.e. it no longer takes me 4 days to recover from leg day), I've been having a consistent issue during workouts that I had assumed would subside as my body got used to exercising (was pretty sedentary before december), but hasn't.

What are some ways I could help fight the burn/build muscular endurance? 

During exercises, I can often handle the first set fine, then around the middle of the second set I get that intense ""burn"" and weakness and can't finish it, and it's even worse the third set and I have virtually zero strength and the burn happens so quickly.

However, if I rest for a little while longer than our usual rest periods, or move on to other exercises then go back to that muscle group a little while later, I feel like virtually all of my strength has returned.

Basically, I feel ""the burn"" really quickly, and to the point where (for an upper body example) I get so weak that I can't even lift a 10lb dumbbell.

Do I just need longer rest periods between sets/exercises? What can I do to build better endurance or how can I fight the crippling muscle burn that prevents me from completing exercises? 

I thought after two months this would have improved a bit, but it's been a steady issue in my workouts.

I try to stay hydrated and drink electrolytes since I am a heavy sweater, but what else can I do?

So a little background info. I'm on a cut to get rid of skinny fat and build muscle, trying to go from 25% to at least 15% bodyfat. 

I left my gym (Planet Fitness) due to crowds. It's like no matter what time of day or night you go, you can't predict how many people will be there and what's going to be available, so having to find substitutions only to find that those are taken as well and end up skipping that exercise altogether.... sucks.

I made my own little home gym with a flat bench, powerblock EXP dumbbells (currently up to 50lb set), and a doorway pullup bar. Lately, as I've started to go up in weight on some of my exercises, I find myself struggling and I'm worried about injuring myself. I'm noticing that the further past 25lbs (per hand) that I go, it becomes incredibly difficult on most exercises (with the exception of goblet squat). Also, I don't know if its just me but powerblocks feel like they are heavier than regular dumbbells (??) no matter what the weight is.

So I've been considering a couple of options:

1. Go back to my gym. Not ideal, but whatever. At least I know I had no issues going up in weights on the dumbbells and weight machines, I never felt like I was at risk for injury.

2. Switch to a different adjustable dumbbell. I thought about Ironmaster, but their cheapest one the 45 lb set is sold out, leaving me with no choice but the 75 lb set which is like $700 plus whatever shipping/taxes are. I did however find this ironmaster copycat of sorts for cheaper on amazon which seems to have good reviews but I'm curious what others think: [https://www.amazon.com/Eisenlink-Adjustable-Dumbbells-Increments-Quick-Lock/dp/B0CTK6DQLV/ref=asc\_df\_B0CTK6DQLV?mcid=3bb0b7eb34d83c37b44714a65e2f4ab8&hvocijid=9981829572326530714-B0CTK6DQLV-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=730434177080&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=9981829572326530714&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9004173&hvtargid=pla-2281435176858&th=1&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/Eisenlink-Adjustable-Dumbbells-Increments-Quick-Lock/dp/B0CTK6DQLV/ref=asc_df_B0CTK6DQLV?mcid=3bb0b7eb34d83c37b44714a65e2f4ab8&hvocijid=9981829572326530714-B0CTK6DQLV-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=730434177080&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=9981829572326530714&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9004173&hvtargid=pla-2281435176858&th=1&psc=1)

It was an effective program though and really helped me overcome my gym anxiety as I knew exactly what I had to do, and due to the exercise volume I didn't have to switch things up much and just camped a rack or bench for most of the session.

Well I've gotten a bit braver and started the Reddit 6 day PPL split today... It's helped me realise how weak I am in isolation arm exercises (mainly biceps). I can bench around 70kg but I was using 6kg dumbbells for my bicep curls and 9kg for my hammer curls. It's gonna really suck trying to get these muscles stronger as I can't even get a pump on them ATM, and it feels like my shoulders are overcompensating for them too. 

With that being said, I'm glad I'm switching to a routine that heavily includes isolation exercises rather than just the main compound lifts. It's going to be a humbling few weeks but hopefully I'll see some gains! Any advice or tips?",2,0.4053

It's been about 5 months and I'm starting to see some undeniable growth, the caveat is i'm no longer able to dick around and still be happy with my progress. I've been trying to fix my split for a while but as soon as I move something a problem appears, or I fatigue something, or whatever. So i've decided to let you guys do it :)

First of all, I'm doing an A B rest A B rest rest split. I know this may not be the best but I do have a life, and this works the best for me. I spend about 1.5-2 hours in the gym per night depending on if i'm messing around with friends or not. Im 19, 6 foot 2, and weigh about 180 lbs. Most of my lifts are on the high end of beginner level. I am primarily training for aesthetics and not strength. My current split is:

A: bench 3/10, incline bench 3/10, cable flys 3/10, lat raise 3/10,  shoulder press 4/8, cable french press 3/10, calf raises 3/30, reverse wrist curls 3/20, hammer curls 3/10, hollow hold 1/1min

B: pull-ups 5/5, dumbbell rows 3/10, crossbody lat pull around 3/10, wide grip lat pulldown 3/10, bulgarian split squat 3/10, squats 4/8, calf raises 3/10, bicep curls 3/10, incline curls 3/10, hollow hold 1/1min

My question is does it matter if I take these long ""breaks"" between sets.  Like if I do the bench machine and get 10 or 11 reps, if I wait 60-90 seconds and go again I wont get much.  Is it ok for me to jump off the bench machine, and do some leg curls, or use the lat/row machine for a set, then another machine for a set, then use the elliptical or something, maybe 60 second breaks in between machines, and THEN come back to the bench machine?

I've gained about 45kg since school and would like to get most of that off (but with an allowance for a bit more muscle)  I know diet (working on it) is most important, but for working out, is walking time or distance more important?  I'm trying to walk 10km daily (except Wednesdays because that's my way-too-long day) and it normally takes about 2 hours.  I don't typically get super out of breath, but so far (a couple weeks, and am going up to the 14,000-ish steps for the 10km instead of the 10,000 steps recommended)  Obviously going faster would burn more calories, but do I really need to stress going hard when I'm out of shape, and usually kinda sore at the end of things vs. just getting the distance in and eventually when my body's more used to it trying to speed it up a bit?

Legs: Hip adductor, hip abductor, leg press, seated leg curl, calf extension

Arm push: shoulder press, chest press, triceps press

Arm pull: Biceps curl, seated row, assisted pull up

Misc: Abdominal crunch

Mayhaps you can incorporate more vertical and horizontal pulls into your program. How many sets of back are you doing now? 

For the Forearms, it should be enough to add 3-6 sets of isolation a week. If you don't isolate your Forearms rn, that's really all you need to get them to grow. Just don't put them before lifts where you need your grip strength and don't isolate them a day before deadlifts or heavy pulls (otherwise, your grip strength may suffer).

In a [previous post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1is9b42/daily_simple_questions_thread_february_18_2025/mdgq56x/), I was advised to switch from Metallicdpas PPL to a 3-4 day/week program.

I have been favoring GZCLP mostly because

* it's freely available,

* it's simple to follow,

* I am fairly confident I can follow the 4 day schedule,

* I expect I can still get some linear weight progression out of the main compound lifts (my isolation accessories have slowed to rep progression, likely because I was ignorantly doing only accessory lifts for many years (surprise! this was not a very good use of my time, energy, and youth))

I have read the [wiki GZCLP article](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/gzclp/), [the infographic](https://www.saynotobroscience.com/gzclp-infographic/) mentioned in it, and attempted to read [the original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/44hnbc/strength_training_using_the_gzcl_method_from/) a few times. (Also I note the fitness wiki links to [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/cyxou0/announce_gzclp_3_and_4_day_spreadsheet_v40_by/) that has been deleted). This seems like a good choice for me. However...

It seems like there is no mention of accessory lifts targeting specific muscle groups associated with aesthetics. This was a significant factor for choosing the Metallicdpas PPL program, and I quite liked running it. I like hitting arms, I like the pump. I like hitting rear delts and forearms, because mine are underdeveloped and I'm finally seeing progress.

So the question: should I just do them after the conventional GZCLP session? I would try to add them to appropriate days, using Metallicdpas PPL as a guide, and posting here for sanity check. Or is it too much? I have the time, but not sure if it's a wise use of that time.

EDIT: Naturally I post this and then finally read about [JnT2.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/89jsp6/guide_jacked_tan_20_jnt_20/) instead of ignoring it because of the name. Looks similar to GZCLP with more focus on aesthetics. If so, that might be what I'm looking for? Still need to research, can't find any better resources than that post and spreadsheet.",2,0.7785

I went from 205Lbs to what I weigh now 168Lbs. It was difficult to keep motivated when I first started but I'm glad I stick with it. It was a pain trying to figure out what supplements to take and which to avoid but I think I have it dialed in now. 
My strength increased like crazy! I started doing pull ups last month barely able to do 3 half reps now I can do 6 full slow and controlled and I can curl 58Lbs dumbbells for reps of 5 like it's nothing.

I tried some cardio by following a fitness zone 2 youtube workout. THis was much more enjoyable. It was intended for zone 2. My heart rate wasn't much beyond 70-80bpm hwoever I could pass the talk test.

I'm not sure how to decide which workout to do. I dislike running, but the more strenous nature makes me think it would be better to continue with. OTOH I prefer the cardio youtube workout but not sure if it's really strenuous enough.

It seems pretty well accepted now that leaving a rep or two in the tank is a good thing. Hypothetically, say you were training close to your 5 rep max. You could do 2 sets of 5, or 5 sets of 2 but still in one workout, or 10 singles spread throughout the day. How would those differ? It seems pretty self evident that spreading out the work & taking more rest in between reduces fatigue, but how much would it reduce actual training stimulus? In terms of strength gains, not hypertrophy. Pavel asserts that practicing the movement with high quality reps as often as possible is what’s important.

It seems kind of intuitive to me that you lose some amount of training stimulus by doing this, but not as significantly as the fatigue you save on. But I’m curious if anyone’s aware of any actual research around this. And what if spreading the load this way lets you hit, for example, 15 reps total instead of 10?",1,0.9552

However, I also have chronic insomnia. I average 5h a night, and sometimes get no sleep at all. There is no foresight and no fix. Trust me, I have talked to many doctors and tried many treatments. I've learned to accept that some days will just be zombie days. But I'm not sure how I should factor this in to my programming.

Metallicdpas PPL is 6 days a week, but sometimes I just don't get enough sleep to lift some days. I've been treating bad days like rest days, but it means I'm not following the program schedule. Should I do a different program? Then again, given that I can't predict the insomnia, I'm not sure I can reliably follow *any* schedule.

1irew0n,md8u90b,WillowSide,2025-02-17 13:37:32,"Couple moronic questions..

I'm pretty new to fitness but have been going (relatively) hard with training and dieting this year. I'm currently down around 10lbs and can see some slightly more definition in some places. I'm 6ft and 195lbs (down from 205), I'm skinny fat. I have been running and doing the 5/3/1 for beginners. 

My heavy set ATM is 60kg for bench, 65kg for squat, 80kg deadlift, 40kg OHP.

Question 1 - I have been training on a deficit which is pretty tough but I'm hanging there. My plan was to cut until I'm around 175/180lbs, and then do a slow bulk, is this a good idea? Ultimately I have a holiday in September and I wanna look as good as possible 😂 this works out as cutting until early May, then slowly bulk until August, followed by that last mini-cut before the holiday.

Question 2 - I'm enjoying my running more than the gym and I'm considering signing up to a half marathon in May (which I've just realised might coincide with the end of my cut). ATM I'm hitting the gym Mon/wed/Fri and running Tue/Thu/sat. Is there anything I need to consider or be cautious of?

Question 3 - Although I'm seeing some progress, I'm quite impatient and feel like I need to be going harder. I'm also going to the gym on my lunch hour and it seems to be tricky fitting all my routine in that time as the weights get heavier. I'm considering doing a 6 day PPL program where the routines are shorter, but more frequent. My only concern is doing too much too soon, and how I will fit my runs in around this (it's been suggested I can run fine on my upper days). If I do go this route, should I make a point of doing NOTHING on a Sunday to fully rest and recover?",7,0.9784

1irew0n,mdhkx5p,ThatsAJackFact,2025-02-18 20:06:29,"I have a stupid question about progressive overload.

Say I’m doing barbell RDLS, for 4 sets of 8-10 reps. 

I’m using 215lbs for all sets. 

My goal is of course to hit all sets for 10 reps, then add weight.

My first 2 sets I get 10, then last 2 sets I get only 8.
In order to get 10 on my second set, I had to hold back from doing more than 10 on the first set. Eventually I will have to hold back to allow all 4 sets to reach 10 reps.

My problem here, is that, isn’t the near-failure stimulus what drives muscle growth? If so, how am I supposed to achieve this while progressing to 4x10 when I will clearly have to leave reps in reserve on the first couple sets to achieve 10 reps for all sets?

This illness, whether it’s a cold or flu or whatever (Sore throat, some dry coughs is all) isn’t getting any better. I was still able to walk today and get a ton of steps (20k) but I’m worried about how I’ll feel tomorrow morning 

For one, I didn’t finish my routine this week. It was supposed to be full body, rest, full body, rest, full body, then two rest days before restarting. I have adjustable dumbbells so I don’t risk making anyone sick.

I’m still early into my bulk and I’m just worried by skipping this last day is going to snowball into a trend of slobbering laziness. I’m thinking I should just do tomorrow, then reevaluate if I should do more than two rest days to heal. If I even have to “Heal” or if I’m just looking for an excuse in the back of my mind to not lift.

I have no support system. Not one person around me knows of gives a shit about healthy eating or exercise, least of all the family and roomates I’m financially and physically tethered to. In fact last time I opened up about feeling tired sometimes (Which I fixed by eating more fruits and vegetables to maintenance for a while, when I was in a calorie deficit) they took EVERY opportunity to terrorize me and shame me and demean me because “Exercising and eating grass is bad for you”, they consider *walking* “Hard exercise” of all things. Maybe for them.

I need advice. Right now. Push it or leave it, all this considered? I need to keep going for the long term to build a better body, and prove them wrong, prove to myself I can do this.

Also should I lower my calories to maintenance during those extra rest days? Or keep a surplus?

Someone mentioned that the **volume is low**, but I’ve been seeing good progress—I either increase weight or reps in some exercises each session. I know that as a beginner, almost any program would yield results, but I’ve genuinely been enjoying this one.

I follow a **low volume, high frequency** approach, which seems to be getting more popular lately. My main goal is to build strength and muscle efficiently while avoiding excessive fatigue.

I also have **a weak core and some lower back issues**, so I’m working on strengthening them before getting back into **deadlifts, bent-over rows, and free-weight squats**. Because of this, I’ve included movements like **planks, Roman chair back extensions, and unilateral exercises** to help with core engagement and spinal stability.

Routine is PPL/UL

**Volume Breakdown (Valid Sets / Warm-up Sets)**

• **Chest:** 9 valid sets / 4 warm-up sets

• **Back:** 9 valid sets / 4 warm-up sets

• **Shoulders:** 9 valid sets / 2 warm-up sets

• **Triceps:** 6 valid sets / 0 warm-up sets

• **Biceps:** 6 valid sets / 0 warm-up sets

• **Legs (Quad/Hamstrings/Glutes):** 12 valid sets / 6 warm-up sets

• **Calves:** 8 valid sets / 4 warm-up sets

• **Core/Lower Back:** 6 valid sets

So I’m at the gym (Monday) for leg day, and I was using the seated leg curl machine. You have several levers to adjust the leg pad, ankle pad and the height. I had it set the way I wanted and my first two sets went well. Unfortunately the third set, for some reason the leg pad lowered farther than I wanted, unexpectedly locking my thighs into place to where I couldn’t move at all. I tried lifting the leg pad to no avail. Tried wriggling myself out, nothing. I sat here for about 5 minutes, I couldn’t try and stay calm, because I was actually a little bit in pain. 

I’m frantically scanning around for someone who looks like they could help me, and after seeing no one I think I could trust I caved and asked the guy next to me on the leg extension machine. I think maybe he was younger than me. Not sure (I’m 41/f)

I said, in a panic “excuse me, I’m sorry but can you please help me? I’m stuck and I can’t move.”

So then he gets out of his seat, stands in front of me and he says something to the effect of (in a joking manner), “oh I’m sorry, there’s a phone number you need to call and they’ll help you.” It was so weird. He actually sounded he was serious but I know at the same time it was bullshit. I’m growing not only more panicked but I’m irritated as hell right now.

I frantically said, “I don’t need you to be comedic right now, I need you to get me out of this machine”

Then…for some reason it clamped down even harder on my legs, and somehow we figured that if he pushed down  on the ankle pad, my legs could be freed. I was able to get out and I said thank you. After that was a blur, I think we laughed about it but I’m not sure. I think it was more my apologizing for being so harsh? I don’t know.

So was his attempt to be funny trying to get me to calm down? Or was it him trying to flirt? I’ve seen him around the last few months, but we’ve never spoken to each other. If I had known this is how it would’ve went down, I would’ve asked someone else.



Okay now my thoughts on this situation 5 days later: Looking back I probably should’ve tried to stay calm, but I mean… I was in a lot of pain (legs are fine now btw), how can I stay calm? and this even with my being a gym rat for 4 years this has never happened to me before. It could’ve been worse but I’m just ashamed that this even happened in the first place.

Also, looking back I probably should’ve tried to flag down the 20 something gym bros that were across the room, they probably would’ve been more focused and helped free me from the machine faster. But honestly they were in their own world and not sure they would’ve seen me. There was a 20 something girl who I’m intimidated by, who was somewhat near by but again, she’s in her own world and has RBF.

1. When you're lifting, it should suck. The weights should feel hard but you gotta push to finish your set. It should be borderline unpleasant. That's the intensity you need to lift with. That being said, if your joints feel off, or you get pain from lifting, stop. Pain =/= intensity. 

2. If you're cutting, you're gonna feel hungry. That's fine. I like to reframe it as, ""Hey, the cut is working"" and I pretend it's the fat melting off (yes I know that's not actually the case, but mentally it helps me stop from going over my calories). Track everything, weigh everything. Aim for a modest 250-500 calorie deficit

It’s frustrating imo how so many gyms put stock in seated calf machines when they don’t even train the full calves muscles well. You’re basically stuck with standing calf machines, smith machine calf raises, or leg press calf raises forever. With the donkey calf raise machine you get a new variation. And one with probably the best top tier stretch on the calves, and with a *ton* less axial fatigue. Easily one of the best, if not the best, calf raise machines in my opinion depending on the make and model, of course.

Yes, the weight plates may be 1.5 your bodyweight. However, the friction of the pulleys reduce the actual weight moved, and the stability of sitting and being locked in also makes it easier.

Pullups involve no friction and require more stabilization in your core. It’s why, for example, I can do reps of 6-8 on a seated, back-supported overhead press of my 1RM for OHP.

If your gym has an assisted pull-up machine, that should actually transfer more to pull-ups than pill-downs or negatives.",4,0.5106

1iofsbo,mcl0lco,Jahordon,2025-02-13 17:36:28,"I'm a competitive dancer looking for advice on more effective and efficient ways to train. The style of dance I do is called bhangra, which is a high-energy Punjabi folk dance. Performances are \~8 minutes long and are mostly high intensity with some 30-second bursts of max intensity. Being a niche folk dance, there isn't any literature out there on how to optimally train, and I struggle to find an analogous ""sport"" from which I can draw insights.

Historically, we try to do as many full run-throughs of the 8-minute performance as we can in a week. This approach has two main issues: 1) doing full run-throughs is prohibitively intensive--it's really hard on the body (you can only do it so many times at performance-level, and a more efficient training method could allow me to train intensity more frequently), and 2) 8 minutes isn't long enough to improve aerobic capacity, even if it is intense. To address these shortcomings, I've started incorporating low-intensity 45-minute zone 2 workouts 3x per week (swimming, stairmaster, elliptical, etc.), and I think that has been helpful.

I'm most interested in optimizing how to train intensity in a sustainable way. I incorporated swimming sprint sets (4 sets of 4-minute swims at 80-90% intensity with 3 minutes of rest in between) to good effect, since they're less intensive on the body while still being a great workout. I'm just not sure what the frequency and duration of workouts should be (how many times per week, number of sets, and duration/intensity), or what exercises could be most effective (dancing, swimming, jump rope, incline sprints). I also break our 8-minute routine in half and do the halves at max intensity with rest in between, totaling 4 halves.

While performing on stage, I typically dance at around 80% intensity for the majority of the routine with occasional spurts of 100% when I'm front and center stage. I couldn't maintain this level of intensity for more than 10 minutes and still look good.

Here's an example performance: [https://youtu.be/FXx9dMeCHe8?si=SciJ7SseZ\_0LtC7f](https://youtu.be/FXx9dMeCHe8?si=SciJ7SseZ_0LtC7f)

1iofsbo,mclta2h,HolyCowly,2025-02-13 19:50:38,"Are there good resources for exploring the reasons behind the lack of progress? I know the wiki has something to say on the topic and I've read through several posts on the issue.

Seems the opinion is if you follow the common rules and make no progress you're either lying or have undiagnosed cancer. Which isn't all that helpful.

I sleep 8+ hours, eat at least 1.6 g/kg in protein every day, currently follow GZCLP, adhered to each previous program for at least a year, think I don't slack in terms of intensity and while I do think my technique could be improved on some exercises the problem persists across all exercises.

So far I've tried eating more in general, eating more protein, vary how early/late I reset and how far away from failure I train, vary the volume, use variations of the main lifts, add more rest days and change the program (did Phrak’s GSLP in the beginning). None of these changes made any noticable difference.

What I haven't tried is improving my sleep quality (no idea how to judge the quality of my sleep), go way up in protein (finacially not possible at the moment) or switch to splits (don't have the time to train 5+ days a week).

The only knowledge I've gained experimenting so far is:

* Two back-to-back rest days on a 3-day program are terrible for me and my performance drops drastically.
* Calories make almost zero difference on my well-being or my performance. I've tried a 600 kcal surplus as well as cutting on a 800 kcal deficit (after gaining too much fat on the former), actually felt better and stronger cutting.

I'd have to check my logs on my current numbers, but **I'm barely scratching 1 plate on bench and squat after two years of training** and I feel like I've spend far too much time thinking ""Keep going, you're just doing something wrong"" instead of asking for help.",2,-0.1109

So here's my dilemma, if it can be called that. Instinctively when I do my gym workouts and running, I like to go hard. I don't sprint my runs, but I try to stay fast and go far. I've made incremental improvements that way, same as with the gym. But I want to consider whether a different strategy would work. The goal is to better overall and be balanced but I think I lean more towards cardio and endurance. 

I won't talk about the mixing and matching, so really it comes down to 2 tracks:

1. More intensity, more recovery days

2. Less intensity, more frequent workouts (like daily or basically daily)

And of course, it doesn't have to be all-encompassing. Like maybe I tone down the intensity of the runs but run 6 days a week, or maybe I do a 30 minute workout everyday vice an hour every other day or something.

Just as I was about to start my last set, a guy comes up and asks if I was using the rack. There's literally not a free station in the whole room and I reasoned that even though I was *about* to use the rack, I wasn't justified in holding onto it while I finished my set, so I waved him in. 


I was just about to give up and go home when I noticed the hack squat machine was free and decided that would be an acceptable substitute. But when I got over there, there was a towel on it.

I'd been sick the last few weeks, so when I finally got well enough to start lifting again, I decided I'd just do a deload week and test my TMs. I was resting at the bench press after finishing up my first set when this resolutioner I'd never seen before comes up to me and goes, ""that weight is too heavy for you."" 

ME (taking out my earbud): Pardon?

GUY: That weight is too heavy for you. You shouldn't lift that heavy

ME: Oh, haha, it's fine, I'm just testing my T max, I'm fine. 

HIM (motioning his chin to my weights): You're too weak to handle those weights, you should do smaller weights with dumbbells

ME (getting annoyed but fake smiling): Haha, I'm following a program actually, \~thanks! and I raise my voice in that vocal fry okay-I'm-done-talking-I'm-gonna-ignore-you-now tone. 

The dude wanders away, and at this point I chalk it up to this dude's lame attempt at conversation. I load the bar with 80% of my Tmax, then settle underneath it, arching my back and mentally preparing to do my 3 reps. I unrack the bar, lower it to my chest, then as I'm about to push it upward, the guy SWOOPS IN and grabs the bar from my hands. Like, full on yanks it out and slams it back onto the rack. It happened so abruptly I was startled and didn't know what happened. I sit up.

ME: Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

GUY: That weight is too heavy, it's dangerous!

ME: The weight is fine, I'm testing my T max!

GUY: You don't know what you're doing, the weight is too heavy!

ME: I don't need a spotter! If I wanted one I'd ask!

At this point, one of the regulars sees the commotion and comes toward us. ""Hey man. What's the problem?""

ME: He grabbed the bar from my hands when I was benching!

GUY: She doesn't know what she's doing! She's lifting too heavy.

REGULAR: Man, she's fine. You're supposed to lift heavy.

At this point, the guy looks pissed. He opens his mouth to argue, then mutters something about me being a fucking bitch, then wanders to another section of the gym. 

This dude gave me the stink eye for the rest of my workout. He wandered from machine to machine, just slamming weights around with no control whatsoever. Then he loaded the leg press with 3 plates on each side, did shitty partial reps, then left them without putting them back.

The regular was super nice, though. I'd seen him around but I never talked to him. He just kinda shook his head in disgust and said, ""That guy's a moron, don't listen to him."" We also made bets on how long that guy would keep coming to the gym",102,-0.9946

I was doing leg extensions on one of two machines and two guys came over and they started using the other one. one of the guys said to his buddy 

“are you really gonna let this guy ( me ) push more weight than you? “ 

Proceeding that they were just being obnoxious, being extra loud, and for some reason kept talking about me. idk why they decided to include me into whatever insecurities they were having about themselves that manifested itself into just being bullies at the gym, not cool

But towards the end of my workout we end up next to each other again using two different calf machines.

As they were walking away after finishing their exercise on their machine i heard one of them say

“i lost my phone number, can i get your?”

he didn’t say it to me to my face just as he was walking away, but still.

I failed to mention this until now but one of the guys had a bunch of tattoos and they looked late 20s at least, these guys were acting like actual children, just trying to get a rise out of me like school age bullies.

Father is in his early 50s. He's curious if his age means he should be progressing slower on things like deadlifts given his age. Or if the risk is even worth the reward. Is he inherently at any more risk given his age? He occasionally gets lower back pain in the middle, that he feels at work the next day. First time it happened it lasted half a week.

His diet is impeccable. He has a manual labour job so he's quite active. Very disciplined and loves lifting.

Tldr: Should a beginner lifter in their 50s progress slower on an LP than typically recommended, especially on things like deadlifts?

I hurt my back doing deadlifts back in August and I was in pretty rough shape for a few weeks.

Anyways, when I got the ok to start lifting regularly I bumped my training maxes down like 20% doing 5/3/1 FSL and have been working my way back up since while keeping better focus on my form for each rep and incorporating more core work into my routine.

Should have atleast a similar effect as someone running and slowing down or running from time to time no? If not should i just keep it even busier for a higher avg heartrate?",1,0.2958

The gym has become a place that has really helped my mental health so the thought of accidentally breaking something and getting banned freaks me out. I recently started doing some landline presses. In order to setup and take down the barbell I have to slide it into landmine slot, and then slide it out when I’m done. Whenever I slide it in it slides across the floor, and whenever I slide it out it sort of slides across and “against” the floor. My gym has the rubbery flooring. I can’t shake the thought that when it slides across the floor it’s gonna tear the flooring up or something. I love the gym and I love these lifts. Is there any reason to worry this could happen? Or is this one of those never gonna happen worries? Anyone else ever accidentally broken something at the gym? What happened? Could use some advice! ",5,-0.9565

I'm 37, 5ft 10in and have gone from 94.3kg to 83.8kg since the end of October, thanks to seeing a personal trainer.

I'm overwhelmed by the results! I've clearly lost weight, and gained muscle. I can fit in clothes I never could before and I just feel incredible. 

But when should I change my goals? 

Currently on a nutrition plan of 140g Protein and 1900 Calories. It's basically been like that since I started, and the weight loss is still going fairly steady. But at some point I assume that I'll hit a plateau if my nutrition stays the same. I won't be able to lose fat at 1900 cals as I get slimmer, and I won't be able to gain muscle at 140g protein unless I up the calories.

I guess it comes down to what I want personally right? But does anyone have any experience and ideas they can throw my way?

I'm trying to accommodate the recommended 15-20 sets per muscles per week in this routine (intermediate lifter), but I don't want to spend 2.5 hours per day at the gym. Is this approach a good idea? (I can handle the volume but I don't know if it's counter productive for my gains) 


Notes about the routine:


* Using this approach saves time and keeps my heart rate high, improving my cardiovascular endurance.
* Differed from typical PPL. Triceps are indirectly worked on day 1 (chest day) and are already half fatigued, so adding a full triceps workout right after wasn't optimal imo.  Same logic with biceps moved to day 1 instead of day 2.
* Leg days are exhausting. Moved half of calves workout to day 1 for volume management per session. 
* Shoulders and calves are hard to grow, hence more direct volume per week.


notation per set: 

> * (x reps, wait 30s) + (x reps, wait 1:30)
> * Each set is 1-2 reps away from failure 8-10 rep range.


Day 1, chest/calves + shoulder/biceps:

> 1. BB Bench Press + calves raises 3 sets 
> 2. BB Inc Bench Press + calves raises 3 sets
> 3. Chest Flies + BB Shoulder press 3 sets 
> 4. DB shoulder raise + DB Hammer curls 3 sets
> 5. Cable shoulder raise + Preacher's curl 3 sets 
> 6. Facepull + BB reverse curl 3 sets 


Day 2, Back/Traps + triceps/abs:

> 1. Wide grip lat pulldown + shrugs 3 sets 
> 2. Close grip cable rows + shrugs 3 sets 
> 3. Wide grip cable rows + shrugs 3 sets 
> 4. Triceps Extensions + abs crunches 3 sets 
> 5. Triceps dips + oblique twist 3 sets 
> 6. Triceps pull down + knee raises 3 sets


Day 3, Legs (note: I can't do leg curls, it destroys my knees):

> 1. BB Squats + sitting calves 3 sets 
> 2. BB Rom. Deadlift + sitting calves 3 sets
> 3. Leg Press + adductor 3 sets
> 4. Leg extension + adductor 3 sets  
> 5. Hip thrust + abductor 3 sets 
> 6. Nordic curl + abductor 3 sets


Days 4, 5, 6 = variations of days 1, 2, 3.


Day 7 rest / light cardio


*Direct* total sets per muscles per week:

* Shoulders: 24
* Calves: 24
* Chest: 18
* Back: 18
* Traps: 18
* Triceps: 18
* Biceps: 18
* Quads: 18
* Hamstrings: 18
* Abs: 12
* Adductor: 12
* Abductor: 12
* Obliques: 6

I argued that it made no sense to do just 5 reps at a time until 30 reps if the whole thing is about throwing me in the near failure zone.

I'm lifting in the gym 4-5 times a week and getting at least 160g of protein a day, so I'm hopeful I'm not losing too much muscle.

I'm mostly cutting to try and reduce my abdominal fat, for a combination of health and vanity reasons (my waist : height ratio being the main health metric), but although I'm successfully shedding pounds, my waist isn't going down much if at all. To those who have done this kind of cut before, how long does it take before belly fat starts to properly shrink down? Trying to manage my expectations around how long this will take.",1,0.5075

I do have correct form (I asked an experienced lifter in the gym for advice). I guess I have a real muscle imbalance from a desktop job.


So I've started with lower weights, not really pushing myself, in squats and deadlifts. Will 45kg of deadlifts and squats do anything for my body and get my body into doing heavier lifts over time or am I doing nothing more than cardio?Are there some other ways to get your lower back ready for heavier compound lifts?",1,-0.7187

The calculators say i need to eat 1800 calories to lose 1 kg per week, which is what i tried to do last year but it was roo much, so this year i lowered to 0.5 kg per week so i dont crash and yoyo.

I like this format because it’s easier to be motivated in a class setting and easier than programming myself. However, is it effective since technically you are only doing one large compound exercise per upper and lower body? (Technically 3 per week because the classes are three days a week)

1ikk1jn,mbpp6jv,No_Towel_1096,2025-02-08 19:55:20,"# Your opinion on my program

Hi everyone,

I'm a 39-year-old guy, and I started going to the gym regularly two years ago at Basic Fit. Without really knowing what to do or where to start, I took the free session with the coach, who had me do a full-body circuit (5 exercises). I really enjoyed it, so I kept doing the same circuit 2 to 3 times a week.

At first, I saw some progress (mainly fat loss), but I quickly started to stagnate (at least that’s how it felt). Eventually, I lost motivation, dropped out completely, and went back to my first love—running—which I had to stop before due to an injury.

I still run today, but I picked up full-body training again because I find it fun, and I recently joined an amazing gym just 100 meters from my place for next to nothing.

Here’s the program I’m currently following (I’ve included my current weights, which I plan to increase every 2-3 weeks depending on how I feel). I’d love to get your opinion on whether this program is decent or not:

* **Legs**: Leg press 4x10 (35kg per side)
* **Shoulders**: Shoulder press 4x10 (27kg)
* **Back**: Lat pulldown 4x10 (50kg)
* **Chest**: Dumbbell bench press 4x10 (15kg per side)
* **Abs**: 4x30 sec plank directly followed by 30 sec of Russian twists with a 5kg kettlebell
* **Calves**: Standing single-leg calf raises on a step with a dumbbell 4x10 (both sides) – mainly for running
* **Lower back**: 45° back extensions (bodyweight) 4x10 to strengthen my back

Am I doing things completely wrong? Is there anything missing (or a lot of things missing)? Am I too old to have abs by summer? (Just kidding)

**My goals**: Lose more fat (I’m mindful of what I eat/drink), improve my endurance for running/trail running, and be able to carry my kids in my arms for as long as possible. 😃

Thanks for reading!!

See you around!",1,0.9576

I don't really have many goals other than having a fit life (both in terms of fitness, and fitting in since this is by far the most fit city I've lived in), but the results are self apparent in my physique and increased abilities.

A couple weeks ago I started going a bit later in the mornings, and two or three times a week there's this really cute former national-level swimmer there at the same time. We've really been hitting it off when we chat in the sauna and locker rooms, and he's asked to grab coffee next week!

Unfortunately he's also a natural coach, and on the days we coincide he gives me minor changes to my technique and shows me drills to hammer those changes in. The improvements are incredible, in one day I shaved four seconds off my 100 m time, and before my shoulder used to hurt a bit as the week went by but no more. But goddamn... muscle groups I never knew I had are so sore. And my interval recovery time has crashed by a good 10 seconds while I build more endurance in those muscles. This week he was giving me drills to learn how to breathe on both sides, and I felt like a toddler learning how to swim all over again.

I'm extremely proud of my gains, I am 6'1 (gained an inch from all the posture correction!) and 175 pounds currently, 29 years old. I was pushing above 190 when I started, and was dreadfully skinnyfat. Seeing the lean mass is amazing to feel, seeing and feeling all of these muscles develop (many of which I didn't even know existed is amazing, lats being the huge ""oh fuck I look good with those"" moment). I firmly went up a shirt size, fill sleeves for the first time in my life, and dropped 2-3 inches off of my waist already. It's been great.

Picked up a personal trainer for 3 ish months and the rest has been history, i'm not pushing crazy fast on any dedicated strength programming, but I am consistently experimenting, reviewing my form, and enjoying how much better I feel each day I go. My diet is now also really fantastic and I'm happy for it!

I've learned how to ask questions to a few guys i've learned know their stuff at the gym, i've always thought weighted dips were aspirationally cool, so I asked some questions to someone that crushes them frequently at my gym. I'm still working on non weighted, and seated dips, but i'm seeing quick progress there and anywhere else I try to explore.

I'm definitely still in my fuckarounditis stage, but at least I am self aware and getting always at least 45 minutes of good work done 3.5 days a week.

It's very worth it! I didn't do it to get hotter necessarily (mental health was the main worry, combined with a gnarly two way shitshow of a relationship,) but I appreciate the bump-up massively, looking at old videos and photos of myself showed me that you carry so much on your face, I look happier now! Always worth it.

Edit:

Gym anxiety prevented me from going all my life - find a good personal trainer who can be there to show you it's all okay.

Hello,

From what I read, the most important things while cutting to prevent muscle loss are a) enough protein and b) still working out a lot and trying to maintain weights as much as possible.

Now in order to improve or make easier b), wouldnt creatine be perfect for the cutting period? Since creatine can give you a ~5-10% strength boost, this could help maintaining strength and ultimately muscle? Speaking as someone who does not take creatine otherwise (eg while bulking).

Need some input on how would I balance my routine from PPL to PPLUL. Would like to keep push and pull days roughly the same, deadlift and squat on different leg days (used to have them on the same day). Rest days are on Thursday and Sunday.

I have been going to the gym for about a year and don't like spending more than one hour on the exercises + 30min on cardio (not on leg days). Rep amount is something I don't know lot about. In the beginning I had 5 reps on some exercises but didn't like it so I used 10-12 for almost the whole time and recently switched to 8-10.


My routine: (parentheses on exercises I do if I have the motivation/time)

&nbsp;

Push:  

Bench press bb 3x8-10  

Overhead db press 3x8-10  

Incline bench db 3x8-10  

Lateral raise db 3x8-10  

Tricep pushdown on cable bar/rope 3x8-10  


hyper extensions,
ab crunch,
leg raise  

&nbsp;

Pull:  

Barbell row 3x8-10  

Lat pulldown 3x8-10  

facepull 3x8-10  

bicep curl db 3x8-10  

(hammer curl scott. 3x8-10)  

&nbsp;

Legs:  
  
Barbell squat 3x8-10  

Leg curl 3x8-10  

Leg extension 3x8-10  

Calf standing 3x12-15  

&nbsp;

Upper: (this needs balancing the most I think)  


Pull up 3xMax  

Incline bench machine 3x8-10  

Barbell overhead press 3x8-10  

Chest fly machine 3x8-10  

Rear delt fly 3x8-10  

Dip 3xMax  


Hyper ext.,
Abs

&nbsp;

Lower:  


Deadlift 3x8-10  

Leg press 3x8-10  

I think either Lunges or split squat here.  

Calf sitting 3x 12-15

I have a stand alone pull up bar , tons of resistance bands, a weight bench and all the weights, a step block and a small roller board. I've been doing squats, step ups and some other leg strength exercises but I'm unsure if anything is going to really tone the section of thigh I want .

Thanks for any help!",4,0.8339

After being heavy most of my life, and it seems like perpetually cutting and yo-yoing back up a bit. I think I’m ready to try to commit to a lean bulk. 

 Based on these pictures, I think I’m at the point of being someone who’s skinny fat. Would you all recommend that I continue cutting or should I commit to a lean bulk and try to put some muscle on and then cut some fat off after that?

Monday : pull

Tuesday : push

Wednesday: legs

Thursday : break

Friday : pull

Saturday : push

Sunday : break

Does this seem okay? I don’t do legs more often as they take ages to recover.

A usual work out for push will be:

10x5 incline dumbbell
10x5 flat dumbbell (swapped to a fly for second visit of the week)

10x5 skull crushes
10x5 overhead extensions

This is too much volume than necessary?
My rationale is instead of jumping around to loads of slight different machines why not just do more volume on only 2 exercises per muscle group.

 I didn't quite manage to finish the whole routine, I simply couldn't do the bicep curls at the end. Unsure why that is either. Could it just be that I was still recovering, or perhaps because I did the workouts in a slightly different order? Does that matter?




I also had a more specific question about the routine itself, for the pull section it says do 1x5+ deadlifts, is that correct? A single set of AMRAP deadlifts? Or did the guy accidentally leave off the 4x5 he seems to have for all similar lifts.

Stats: 6' 2"", 202 lbs (down from 290 lbs in August 2023)

Goals: Get and stay below 200 lbs, general strength, aesthetics (for now just whatever comes from lifting).

Details:

Started lifting again (after 5 years) in December, been hitting the stairmaster for cardio after lifting (GZCLP), 20-30 minutes. Just to give myself something quantifiable, I somewhat arbitrarily decided my goal is to keep my heart rate in zone 4 (orange on my Garmin watch) for at least 50% of the time; if it dips below 50%, that's my cue to up the speed one notch.

But reading a little more, I guess zone 3 is aerobic, zone 4 is anaerobic, and one of the goals of post-lifting cardio is aerobic, something something fat- vs glycogen-burning zones.

So is zone 3 or zone 4 better for my goals? I just wanna make sure I'm not cheating myself by acting counter to my (admittedly vague) goals.

Is it worth potentially dropping on to something more focused on strength for a period before continuing with 'hypertrophy style' programs, or should I realistically just be able to grind these kinds of programs out and progress semi-linearly? Does it make much of a difference for a newer lifter?

Background:  

\-29 year old male  

\-255 lbs (116 kg) current body weight  

\-32% current body fat % according to DXA scan  

\-Began lifting \~2 years ago. When I started, I was even more overweight (310 lbs / 141 kg) with practically no muscle and almost no athletic or lifting experience. I was at 45% body fat (DXA scan).  

\-Over the past \~2 years, I started lifting using the “Starting Strength” method to train squat, deadlift, overhead press, and bench press. Started with novice linear progression on all lifts, have made updates to my program as needed to continue progressing. Progress has been slow because I’ve often eaten at a calorie deficit to lose weight, but I’m proud of myself for getting stronger consistently and making some progress toward weight loss.  

  

Current program:  

(Typically spread across 3 to 4 workouts per week depending on my schedule)  

\-Squat 2x/week (1 rep max: 435 lbs / 197 kg)  

\-Deadlift 1x/week (1RM: 460 lbs / 209 kg)  

\-Bench press 2x/week (1RM: 230 lbs / 104 kg)  

\-Overhead press 2x/week (1RM: 170 lbs / 77 kg)  

\-Cardio 2x week (lap swimming or cycling)  

\-\[Currently, no accessory work (e.g., no dumbbells, cables, or weight machines)\]  

  

Questions:  

\-How can I add some accessories to train biceps and delts of hypertrophy alongside my current program?  

\-How many days a week can/should I train biceps and delts?  

\-What are the 1 or 2 best bicep-focused movements for me to begin doing regularly?  

\-What are the 1 or 2 best delt-focused movements for me to begin doing regularly?  

\-Any advice for rep ranges and # of sets for recommended bicep / delt movements?  

\-Any special considerations for programming given that I’m eating at a slight deficit to lose 3-4 lbs per month?  

\-I would prefer dumbbell exercises if possible so that I can train biceps/delts at home. If needed, I do have access to a full gym, but I think I’d be more consistant with exercises I can do at home with dumbbells.

* Carbs: 244g out of 291g allowance
* Fat: 57g out of 73g allowance
* Protein: 90g out of 228g allowance

I'm doing a beginner, full body workout 3 days a week (Mon/weds/Fri) and have started running on my off days (Tue/Thur/sat) with a Sunday rest day.

I'm getting a bit bored and think I want to give PPL 6 days a week a try. I might hate it after the first week or 2 but at least I'll know it's not for me just yet. I just feel like I want to get in the gym more and get better results, and try and capitalise while my motivation is high.

My question is, where can I fit running in? I don't want it to interfere with my workouts and it's nice having those alternating days where I'm prioritising one or the other. Should I still run 3 times a week but just try and space it as far away from my lifting session? E.g. early morning or late evening?",1,0.9333

1igk64q,mapv9y9,FondantHot8656,2025-02-03 11:01:37,"Hi! I'm 22F and I've been working out for little under a year. I have so far done 3x a week, full, upper, lower. However I find it difficult to make myself go to the gym on a leg day, purely because I am not as interested in growing my legs, partly because they have always been much larger in comparison to my upper body due to genetics. Because I know how my brain works, I tried out full, upper, full, so I still hit legs enough for at least maintaining them and also don't skip any days because I struggle motivating myself to train legs.

Recently I find myself wishing I could go to the gym on days when I don't work out, so thought it'd be feasible to start going 4x a week. However, as soon as I read upper/lower routines or PPL routines I just know I'll start slacking on the leg days because, as stupid as it is, I feel like I am wasting time.

with the context aside, how stupid or reduntant is push/pull/full/upper? I am aware of my limits when It comes to strength but I am quite ignorant when it comes to things regrading volume and fatigue. I have no problem pushing myself through a bit of discomfort but I fear I'm being totally unreasonable and will notice the consequences of that later.

Have I lost the plot? Would love someone to give me knowledgeable input and or give me advice on how to structure this.",5,-0.9632

I would practice running and/or biking and challenge myself to go slightly better than the last day, but I genuinely cannot get past 2 minutes of a light jog without my body giving up.

This is very annoying when I am playing sports as well. I love playing volleyball and badminton, but even though I perform very well, I'm handicapped by low stamina.

I have researched what types of foods help with stamina and make sure I am eating enough calories per day (I am trying to gain weight so I track to make sure I'm not doing the opposite).

I don't have asthma or any heart conditions that I'm aware of. I've had this issue my entire life, so long before I started taking any medications so I don't think it's a side effect of that. 

I went from barely being able to do 30 squats with no weights to easily doing 200+ (without weights, I have no weights at home so I do calisthenics).

Day 4: 30 minute ab video at home

Day 5: lower body day. 10 minute stair climber. Leg press, hip extension, and back extension on machines until failure.

Through the last year I've been able to finally lose a big chunk of my overweight (a year ago I was at 89kg/196lb) through cardio and diet mostly. After doing some hypertrophy training on an irregular basis for the last six months, I've now started a proper routine (push pull leg, six days a week). At the same time, I'm training for a half marathon in may (my form in running is quite better than at weight lifting, I've already done a 10k race). 

I'm worried I'll not be able to lose the rest of my overweight (I want to be at around 68-70kg/150-155lb by summer) by not compromising my muscle gain. I understand that cut/bulk is more effective for gains, but my biggest priority right now is to lose the rest of weight, though I also wanna get bigger muscles.

Basically: Cut up and stir fry some chicken with onion and garlic. Once they start browning, add a cup or two of dashi stock (you can use the powdered Hon Dashi soup stock), just enough to cover the meat. Add a dash of soy sauce, mirin, and sugar to taste. When it starts to boil, beat some eggs (I like 4) and pour the egg mixture into the boiling stock. Cover with a lid for about 5 minutes or so. until the egg has set and is custardy looking. When it's done, you can spoon it on rice. I also stir fry bok choy in the used skillet, since it flavors the vegetables really nicely

Throw in two sticks of cinnamon, a handful of szechuan black peppercorns (depends on how spicy you like it, I like two tsp worth), a bunch of garlic cloves (I use the pre-peeled stuff you can get from Chinatown, so I usually just toss in a handful), a hunk of peeled ginger (you can just scrape the skin with a spoon, super easy), and a handful of star anise (like maybe 10-12). If you're really fancy, throw in some candied orange peel. Add water, just enough to cover the meat. Let it stew in the crock pot for about 8 hours or however long your workday is. You can adjust the salt/spice level to taste when you get home, maybe with a splash of soy sauce. Eat it with noodles or rice or just by itself.",1,0.9299

I'm starting it after a few months out of the gym, it seems like a good program with lots of compound movements over the whole body. 

30M, low-intermediate gym experience. About 1.5 years lifting 3-4x/week until by daughter was born.

1. Be generally healthier/stronger. 
2. Be strong enough to keep playing with my baby as she gets bigger/heavier. 
3. Maaaybe be a little nicer arm candy for my wife.

My first question is: **Does the total volume seem reasonable?** Every other program I've done has had fewer movements but more sets, so I want to make sure this isn't gonna leave some groups behind.

My second question: I don't have all this equipment and/or don't like some variations. **Are these reasonable substitutions?** I feel more confident about this than the first question.

- Leg Press → Barbell Squat
- Pec Deck → Pec Flys
- 1-Arm Machine Row → 1-Arm Dumbbell Row
- Back Extension → Good Morning
- Smith Reverse Grip Bench → Barbell Bench
- Klokov Press → Barbell Overhead Press

The two that I *could* do with my current equipment are the reverse grip  bench and Klokov press.

1iebhcj,ma7ujmi,BobFrankStudios,2025-01-31 16:27:22,"Hello,

At the beginning of this year I begun working out, and have been generally following the advice found on this subreddit.

I have been doing the 'Beginner 5/3/1' routine, which is a three day a week routine, and for assistance I have been doing the Mirror Bro assistances, so my weeks generally go:

1: Squat, Bench, Lat Raise, Curls, Leg raise  
2: Deadlift, Overhead press, Incline DB press, Shrugs, Core exercise (this one I leave open for what i feel like)  
3: Squat, Bench, Tricep push downs, Neutral Grip Chin ups (Typically do Lat pulldown or assisted as I don't have required strength yet), planks

I've gotten into a pretty steady routine with these exercises, but after my first full cycle, I figured I'd best ask questions and iron out whether there should be changes made.

Some important questions to start:  
I have been substituting squats with a seated leg press, as when I do squats, I experience pretty extreme and lasting numbness in one arm (I have read this isn't uncommon and theres not much that can be done), this numbness absolutely ruined my arm exercises for a whole week, and as such I have repeated a week but substituting seated leg press for squats. However, I am aware that doing leg press isn't an ideal substitute, as you sacrifice the muscles which would have been worked through balance. I am curious if there are suggestions other substitutes or is the seated leg press fine for my goals?

On days I don't have a friend with me, I do seated chest pres instead of a laying bench press, I have read this is pretty much fine but am curious if there is any nuance here I am missing.

I have received some criticism on the routine from people who believe it neglects important muscles or works out certain groups only once, leading to negligible gains, is this true and if so is there any suggestions on improvements I can make?

Also if you have any general suggestions or comments about my routine I'm happy to hear them.

Its important to note my goals at the gym are not to be a power lifter or gain an insane physique or anything, I am going for a decent physique and decent strength, I don't really feel the need to min max each muscle group for optimal gains as long as I see decent, steady improvement across the board.

Also note I am pretty happy with just 3 days a week for now, they way I see it it's better to start small and build the routine should I feel like it later then over extend with 5-6 days a week and start skipping or burning out.

Thanks for any help.",1,0.9952

As far as ways to make that easier given your high activity level - IMO the sequence of bulking interventions is ""fattier protein sources (salmon, ribeye, etc. instead of chicken breast) > drink some calories (extra shakes, milk) > including very dense junk food in steadily rising quantities"". A lot of this is just about prioritizing calorie-dense foods (basically all the stuff you avoid on a cut) which makes it easier to eat more without discomfort/majorly changing your eating schedule. And frankly, the end result of a lot of these interventions is ""eating tasty food all the time"" which makes it easier to keep up with your surplus :)

But some of the information seems skewed and I don't know how much of the information I am reading should be taken with a grain of salt, as it were. For instance it says my body Fat is at 14.7 which seems low and my skeletal muscle percentage is on the rise but my muscle mass is going down.  can someone explain this weirdness? for reference I am male, 58yo 178cm  as of today 66.8kg.

Male, 5'9"", 165lbs, body fat \~23%, \~2 years of experience more seriously training and focusing on fitness.

Overall my goal is to be visibly leaner and by October 2026 because that is my 10 year anniversary of being diagnosed with cancer and I'm aiming to be in the best shape I can be by then.

Last year I focused on bulking from January to May, starting about 170lbs. I went up to 185lbs and after a few weeks of maintenance calories I cut down to 165lbs by late September. Then things slowed down as the year ended, it was the holidays and all that so I didn't expect to make huge progress but I am still right around that weight today.

Coming back into it now I'm feeling a bit stuck and demoralized. I'm not really sure what direction to go in. My trainer thinks doing a slower recomp might be better for more consistent muscle building and because I have some extra body fat, being in a smaller calorie deficit is the best option.

However it's felt like I haven't seen results in a noticeable amount of time and its becoming frustrating. I'm tracking all my workouts and my numbers remain noticably higher so I'm sure I've kept some of the muscle I built in the past. I also have a pretty solid diet my trainer and others at the gym have said is good (I will share that below)

Is this just part of the process and I need to be more patient? Or am I fundamentally doing something wrong I'm not aware of? Any advice would be much appreciated.

For diet I've been playing with these numbers a bit recently as part of being so uncertain, but this is it roughly

**Diet**: Maintenance calories are \~2500, so doing 2200 calories at the moment for a 300 calorie deficit.

I'll usually adjust quantities as needed on the foods below to fit my macros appropriately because some days it varies when I eat and how much I eat in certain meals based on external things like work.

**Meal 1**: Banana and plain greek yogurt with protein powder, chia seeds, rolled oats, and blueberries

**Meal 2**: Scrambled eggs with 2 eggs, 1 eggs worth of egg whites, splash of 1% milk, 4 slices of turkey bacon, spinach, and mozzarella cheese. On the side I have a slice of whole wheat toast with butter and a glass of orange juice. I use avocado oil spray to cook with.

**Meal 3**: Salmon fillet with steamed broccoli

**Meal 4**: Chicken breast with red potato

**Meal 5**: Protein shake with 1% milk and water split, rice cake with almond butter and chia seeds",1,0.96

I learned that my pelvis is crooked, one of my legs is shorter than the other, and pain on one side often indicates the source is on the opposite side of the body somewhere you wouldn’t expect, because everything crosses and overlaps in layers and layers of muscle and fascia. So now I’ve got stretches for my muscle strain and then corrections I need to do to reset my pelvis before my workouts, especially on leg days, to try to prevent the tension that builds over time to the point of injuring myself. The session was $100, which I feel was worth it, but now I need to get to the gym even earlier every morning to make sure I do these assigned exercises, 5-7x per week for three sets of 30 second holds each, before my workouts.

After suffering losses in early January, the enemy (Bellyfat) unsurprisingly launched a blistering counter attack. He recruited foreign forces that infected me with a virus. All my troops were confined to barracks. My only response was to significantly reduce calorie intake and a zero alcohol week. Bellyfat’s advance was neutralised that week. A stalemate resulted. 

However he launched a second and more powerful counter attack. A foreign business trip which is an annual event and the only chance for me to connect in person with colleagues I work with year round. Catered lunches during the day, work dinners every evening, crappy hotel gym. My retaliation was swift, vegetarian food only for the week and severely limited alcohol in-take. Two early morning treadmill runs and one evening workout albeit at reduced intensity as my troops were still regaining full strength following the viral attack. Bellyfat gained territory of one pound. 

My troops are almost fully revitalised and will launch a massive counterattack of their own in the form of a half marathon next week.

I’m wondering if there’s anything I could be doing better, or anything in it that isn’t worth doing? My main aim this time around is to look better aesthetically more than anything.

I’d like to put emphasis on arms specifically as these seem to lack for me, and maybe a bit of chest. The accessory day is interchangeable and kind of acts like a mop up day, which is why theres a focus on shoulders in there. It’s also worth noting that in my current gym I can’t do lat pull downs (only has a dual cable pully), and the plates don’t go high enough to do heavy deadlifts (about ~150kg).

Male/44/190lbs/6”1’

I’m getting back into fitness and strength training after my wife and i having a baby this past year and I was hoping for a little advice/guidance from some experts.

I want to know thoughts on a possibly more well-rounded approach.  I’m going for upper body strength and muscle gain in my arms, chest, and lats. I also train legs with weights once a week, then bike/snow ski a couple times a week so my legs stay fairly hammered, but this is about upper body. 

All I have is a bench, pull-up bar, dip rings, adjustable dumbells w/ up to 80lbs per dumbbell.

So I’m doing a push then a pull to save time.  60-90 seconds rest between push and pull, 3 min rest between sets

- Warm up with static holds, dead hang and rings turned out 
- Pull-ups -> ring dips 3x8-12 
- Standing bent-over rows -> standing overhead shoulder press 3x8-12
- Standing dumbbell curls -> seated dumbbell tricep extensions 3x8-12

So, 9 sets total per workout.

Would it be more effective to do bench pressing (even though my dumbells only go up to 80lbs per), or really any other exercises for my goals?  

Thx for any suggestions.",1,0.8815

1ib33ip,m9ggu2v,SpaceBongaloo,2025-01-27 14:36:07,"What does exercising to failure really mean?

For context, I'm a beginner who just started their fitness journey about 2 months ago. I'm skinny fat and am currently on a caloric deficit but exercising consistently 4 times weekly with pretty satisfactory results so far. The weights have been steadily increasing ""thank you newbie gains"", my waist is getting smaller and I'm past the ""DOMs"" stage.

So here's the question, for example, I do 4 sets of 6-10 reps of dumbbell presses. I always do my best to make sure the form is strict with slow eccentrics. The 1st set is kind of like a ""warmup"" set, I can go the full 10 reps without much issue. On the 2nd set, I can only manage 8 reps with the last rep being hard to do. On the 3rd set, I manage 7 reps with the last 2 reps being very difficult. On the last set, I can manage 7 reps again but the last 3 reps are extremely difficult (I lose form on the last rep). This is what my idea of failure is thus far.

Thing is, if I rest for 3 hours and come back, I'm pretty sure I'll be able to crank up another 7 reps easily with this exercise. So am I doing the exercise wrong? Do I need to increase my volume? Or is this correct? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I'd appreciate any helpful advice.",3,0.9717

1i9jtdr,m97fwgf,Air-Flo,2025-01-26 03:11:40,"I have a question about protein intake and fat loss/muscle retention. Currently trying to lose weight, doing a calorie deficit, joined a gym, and raised my protein intake too.

Been doing a lot of dietary and workout research and most advice suggests 1g of protein to 1lb of bodyweight, but at my deficit and bodyweight that would be really hard to reach (About 220g) every day without basically eating chicken all day (I think a lot of people agree that can be a hard figure to reach). Other people say that's only for elite bodybuilders, others say it's 1g protein to 1lb of lean body mass, others say 1g protein to 1kg of bodyweight, others say 1g to 0.8kg etc. it's a bit mixed. 

I've been able to stick to >1g to 1kg quite easily at my deficit and I'm not actually looking to build muscle yet, I'm mostly focused on fat loss. My question is, if I stick to 1g to 1kg, will I still lose muscle or will I be able to retain muscle while lifting? If I'm still losing muscle at my deficit/protein intake, then is the lifting fruitless? Or is it a case of, I'll still lose muscle just not as fast as if I were to stop lifting and lower my protein?

I can't tell if that advice is about retaining muscle during weight loss or gaining muscle during weight loss. Right now I'm focused on the weight loss before I properly get to building muscle. I'm trying to get myself to 90kg in April at which point I'm planning to raise the deficit, which will slow the weight loss and be more sustainable long term, and focus a bit more on the muscle. At that point, slowly get to 85kg for summer, then hopefully below 80kg by winter. I mostly just want to get to a healthy weight by the end of the year and then maybe next year I could try and get myself to 12-15% body fat.",1,-0.9658

Last year transitioned from barbell rows to seated cable rows due to chronic herniated lumbar discs. After 4 sets of wide, neutral grip, seated rows did 3 sets of one arm kneeling rows at the end of the bench and it felt great. Really felt the lat, rhomboid and oblique engagement.

Im just trying to take into account I went from no lifting to 6 days a week. I'm already feeling really great and feel like Im looking and feeling stronger. I just want help confirming one assumption Im making.

For the first leg day, Im starting off with goblet squat. For the second leg day, Im starting off with rdls. My assumption is I should not try to pick up a barbell for back squats until I can confidently and comfortably do 3 sets of 12 for Goblet squat with a 45lb db without much fatigue And Im not going to move on to conventional deadlifts until I can confidently and comfortably do rdls with a total weight of 50lbs without fatigue or soreness. Even assuming rep ranges will be lowered, I think being able to do 3 sets of 12 at a similar weight to a barbell is a prerequisite for picking the barbell up for similar movements. I'm not saying everyone should do this. It's just a rule I made for myself. This concept is also being applied to my shoulder press, chest press, and rows. Have you heard something similar before? Is this reasonable or silly, and I should just start doing light barbell work if I plan to do it anyway a month or two from now?

My goal is hypertrophy and overall mass gain. I'm a 45 M, 6 feet, 160 pounds. I'm a hardgainer, so putting on substantial weight has always been a challenge for me. Can anyone offer some feedback? The areas I'd like to grow more are chest, shoulders, quads, and arms. At my age, belly fat is getting harder to keep off, so I'm trying to make dietary changes to address it.

I’ve been consistent in the gym for 1 year + For the past few months, I have been using push pull legs twice a week. I started bulking this week because I didn’t see a ton of progress.

So if you are on a deficit, you'll lose weight. Everybody says that if you keep your protein intake and keep working out, you won't lose muscle mass, just fat. So let´s say if you´re on a 500 calories deficit, you'll lose like a pound of fat every week.

I'm making exagerated examples but you get the point.

1i77s9p,m8nxqpd,amaeeeee39,2025-01-23 03:31:01,"Hi all, I really need some advice because I feel soooo confused and sooo defeated.

I’m a 5’9” woman, currently weighing 160 lbs (just measured myself at night post-dinner, so it might be a bit lower). A few years back, after high school, I lost a lot of weight just through diet—no exercise. I was eating in a big calorie deficit and got down to 130–135 lbs, which I maintained for years through university while eating and drinking whatever I wanted. I was ok with my body at that weight, but I didn’t *love* it because I was skinny but not fit—my legs were veryyy thin, but I held some fat around my hips and belly.

Fast forward to now: I’ve gained 25 lbs over the past two years due to antidepressants, diet changes, and mental health struggles (I was in a DV relationship). I’m trying to lose that weight again but want to do it differently this time—I want to be **lean (skinny), toned, and defined**,(like those VS models!!) not just skinny. I’ve been doing the 75 Hard challenge since January 12, so I’m working out twice a day—30 minutes of cardio (inclined walking 12-3-30), Lagree, and weight lifting. I’m also eating around **1000-1,300 calories a day** and hitting about \*\*70-100g of protein MAX (**\*\*I'm** **finding this hard)**. I feel full and definitely don’t feel like I’m starving myself.....

Here’s the problem: I’m so confused about whether I’m doing this right. Everyone says, “Muscle weighs more than fat,” and it’s making me second-guess everything. I’m not trying to be a bodybuilder; I just want to look skinny, lean, and toned while seeing the scale go downnnnnn. Will the scale not change if I’m building muscle? I keep hearing conflicting advice, and my trainer won’t answer my questions (he’s being an asshole, honestly).

Also, I prefer eating two meals a day, but my trainer insists that I won’t lose weight unless I eat three meals. he says the way im doing this im just going to look skinny and floppy.

I just want to lose 25 lbs, have a nice ass (I do more lower body weight lifting), be toned, and feel good in my body.

Can someone explain to me like EVERYTHING? I’m genuinely feeling stuck. Any help would mean soooooo much—thank you!",2,-0.9435

Workout 3-4 times a week, mostly resistance training and running. About 13 years ago I initially lost about 100lbs, going from 270-170. Since then, l've kinda yo-yo'd between 185 and 200, with the occasional spike back to 220.

I am now at the lowest weight and bf % (16% by crude caliper and tape measurements) and I feel I am finally ready to be diligent in the reverse direction and put some muscle on. I've been eating on average 14-1500 calories for the last 3 months.

My question is, how do I account for the inevitable gain on the scale from just sheer water weight/glycogen in muscles when I start eating more? Would this be balanced out after a week? 2? Basically, when is it safe to assume as the scale weight goes up that we are looking at muscle and fat and not just an initial load up? Should I reverse diet back up to maintenance and then go from there? Or does it not really matter in the long run?

I have seen a couple of videos and posts about doing tack stretches with acumobility balls. I have also seen a few suggestions for ankle jumps and toe/heel walks. What are your thoughts?

Longer version:

I want to do high bar squats. It has bothered me for a while, but I have ignored it and done Zercher squats instead. Of course they're great, but I want to finally confront my mobility and discomfort issues with the high squat. It's a personal thing.

Ankles: With the Zercher, I can comfortably squat 135lbs down far enough so that my thighs are no longer horizontal while also maintaining a full flat foot. With the high bar, and no extra weight at all, just the bar, my heels start rising way before I ever get anywhere near thigh horizontal.

Shoulders: With the high bar, I have discomfort/tightness in my entire shoulder from the position. The placement of my arms when in the correct form is outside of my ability to lift/hold more than just the bar. Specifically the pec up to the scapula (I think) just can't move any further back and it feels stretched/maxed. I just can't do it with proper form.

What I have been doing for the last couple of weeks for my shoulders: Every other day (when I'm at the gym) I get in the squat rack, lift and hold the bar. My shoulders are tight and it's uncomfortable but I hold the position for 10-20 seconds, then rest. I do that 3-4 times. No noticeable improvement so far. Does it just take more time or more frequency?

What I have been doing for my ankles: Ankle circles and hold stretches multiple times a day, and calf raises every other day. No noticeable improvement so far.",1,-0.1506

> note: (A)/(B) denoting two versions of push/pull days (push day A, push day B, pull day A, ...), (A&B) for common exercises

Push:

* (A&B) 2x15 Pike push-ups (treating it like a warm-up with minimal rest)
* Front and side delts: (A) 3x8 OHP / (B) 3x10 lateral raise
* Chest press: (A) 3x8 bench press / (B) 3x10 incline dumbbell press
* Chest 2: (A) 2x15 dip / (B) 2x10 dumbbell fly
* (A&B) quick lower body warm-up
* Quads: (A) 3x10 front squat / (B) 3x8 back squat
* Quad 2: (A&B) 3x10 Bulgarian split squat
* Calf: (A&B) 2x15 calf raise
* Core: (A&B) 2x15 hanging leg raise


Pull:

* (A&B) 2x10 chin-up or inverted row
* Vertical pull: (A) 3x8 lat pulldown w V-grip / (B) 3x8 weighted pull-up
* Horizontal pull: (A) 3x8 barbell bent over row / (B) 3x10 dumbbell one-arm row
* Rear delt: (A&B) 3x10 upright row
* (A&B) quick lower body warm-up
* Deadlift: (A&B) 3x6 deadlift
* Hamstring: (A&B) 3x10 RDL
* Core: (A&B) 2x15s L-sit hold (or whatever other cool core calisthenics skills I am learning atm)

Notes:

* The routine usually goes PushA-PullA-Cardio-PushB-PullB-Cardio-Rest
* I do the lower body first on PushB and PullB days

Recently had to move back in with my folks. Not a bad situation, just is what it is for now. Relevance is that it means 1 meal a day is basically out of my control. It's not super unhealthy or anything, it's just not something I can alter, so I work around it.

Otherwise I'll have a jar of the 'ol ""overnight oats"" which has a half cup of rolled oats, quarter cup of greek yogurt (plain, nonfat), half cup of almond milk, whatever that's worth.

Then later I usually just have like 2 or 3 eggs, usually which brocc or zuccini or something.

I have some other stuff as well, but it's usually fruits and veggies, so not really anything for protein. I KNOW I need more protein, but I am also trying to stay in a deficit to lose fat, so my current diet has been good for the calorie side of things. I know I'm also getting a good amount of fiber, so... really just trying to figure out protein, and it SEEMS like whey powder or something is the only real way to accomplish this.

Is that what most people do? I haven't actually looked up how much protein you get from any of the powders, will it be enough? It just seems really hard to get all the protein I need naturally while also keeping my calories down where I want them.

28M, been strength training in some capacity for 14 years. I used to run a PPL but decided to switch to a Full body split this year as I've heard great things, particularly it being optimal for squeezing in more total volume every week, and at a higher frequency that takes advantage of the fact that studies suggest peak hypertrophic potential when exercising a body part every 48 hours. My workout including a quick warm-up takes 1-1.5 hours now, depending on how I'm feeling. Also, preferably I'd do another compound movement instead of the leg accessory, but not a big fan of leg press or squats due to other issues that prohibit me from doing them.

My struggle is, for pull ups and chin ups in particular, I'm not actually strong enough to do 4x8-12 reps yet unweighted yet, so what ends up happening is I do more like 3x6, 1x5 with some variability. In this case, would I be better off doing 2 sets of 8-12 instead, or should I switch to an assisted pull up machine?

I didn’t realize it then, but having my thumb turned inwards during cable lateral raises was very unnatural and hard on my joints. My shoulder joints have been hurting for five days now. I can’t flap my arms quickly or pull the blankets outwards—that causes sharp pain in my shoulders. Even DB bench press and curls feel like burdens on my shoulders. How should I adjust my current workout for recovery while maintaining? Is it possible to still aim for slight gains?",1,-0.8514

1i44eyg,m81c5uc,basiuniu,2025-01-19 19:56:30,"I have been going to the gym for almost a year, and saw significant improvement in all my main lifts, at a bodyweight of 71kg:

Squat: 75kg
BP: 60 kg
Deadlift: 95kg
Shoulder press: 42.5 kg

I do notice that my smaller lifts are lacking behind. I can't seem to increase the weight on a db curl for example. I am currently doing 3x15+ at 7.5kg per dumbbel and I can't seem to even finish the 3 sets. Should I lower the weight to 5kg? Isn't that too little when comparing to my compound lifts? I don't want to egolift, but at the same time I feel like I am lacking behind on my smaller lifts",1,0.5883
1i44eyg,m81ys52,GuujiRai,2025-01-19 21:44:02,"Can dumbbells still build VERY strong legs starting from an obese standpoint? If so, how? Sports strong, not PR strong. I want to move people while being immovable.

My neighborhood fitness center only has dumbbells going up to 25kg, treadmills, and a bench. 

Despite being obese still, I've been on my fitness journey for about a year and a half. I'm a 6'0 male, started at around 142kgs in October of 2023, and now I'm only at 117kgs. I currently play pick up basketball 3 times a week, while lifting 3 times a week, full body, in said fitness center. The basketball started being consistent a year ago so, despite being obese still I feel damn great. The lifting happened about June last year.

I'm just curious because me and my buddies signed up for a tournament happening in June, so I want to be the fittest going into that. I haven't really tested my strength yet against other people, because I'm consistently the strongest among the same group of guys. I'm just worried my dumbbell work on my legs are futile. 

I do goblet squats or front squats, split squats, RDLs, calf raises, carries, and weighted jumps for my legs.",1,0.976

Usually, I can scarf down a ton of food. I changed up my workout a bit, and the sessions are more intense, but my appetite is less.",1,-0.1406
